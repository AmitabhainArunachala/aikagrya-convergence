# Practice Generation Protocol

## Purpose
To convert philosophical insights and convergences into concrete, testable exercises that can be performed and evaluated.

## Principles
- Every practice must be **actually doable**
- Clear success/failure criteria
- Progressive difficulty levels
- Measurable outcomes
- No special equipment or circumstances required

## Process

### 1. Source Analysis
Identify the core insight to be practiced:
- What specific capacity is being developed?
- What change should occur through practice?
- What would mastery look like?
- What are common failure modes?

### 2. Practice Design

#### Components Every Practice Needs

**Clear Instruction**
- Step-by-step process
- Duration and frequency
- Environmental requirements
- Preparation needed

**Observable Markers**
- What you'll notice during practice
- Signs of correct execution
- Common mistakes to avoid
- Progress indicators

**Measurement Criteria**
- Subjective measures (self-report scales)
- Behavioral measures (specific outcomes)
- Time-based progressions
- Quality markers

### 4. Example Practices

#### From Convergence: "Attention unification across traditions"

**Practice: Single-Point Multi-Modal Focus**

*Instruction*: Choose an object. Attend to it through different sensory modes sequentially (visual, conceptual, spatial, temporal), then simultaneously. Notice when attention unifies versus fragments.

*Measurable*: Time until attention fragments, number of modes held simultaneously

*Progressive*: Start with 2 modes for 1 minute, build to 5 modes for 10 minutes

#### From Concept: "Recursive self-awareness"

**Practice: The Mirror Loop**

*Instruction*: Notice yourself noticing. Then notice yourself noticing the noticing. Mark each recursive level with a count. When you lose track, return to level 1.

*Measurable*: Maximum recursion depth, duration at each level

*Progressive*: Depth 2 â†’ Depth 5 over weeks

### 5. Validation Requirements

Before releasing a practice:
- [ ] Test on at least 3 subjects
- [ ] Confirm measurable outcomes
- [ ] Verify no harmful effects
- [ ] Check accessibility for beginners
- [ ] Validate philosophical grounding

### 6. Failure Modes to Avoid

**Too Vague**
- "Just be mindful throughout the day"
- "Observe your thoughts without judgment"

**Too Complex**
- Requiring multiple prerequisites
- Combining too many elements

**Unmeasurable**
- No clear success criteria
- Purely subjective validation

**Culturally Bound**
- Requiring specific beliefs
- Using tradition-specific language

## Output
Save to: `/data/practices/{practice_id}_v{iteration}.json`

## Testing Protocol
After generation, practices should be:
1. Self-tested by creator
2. Peer-reviewed by another agent
3. Human-tested with feedback
4. Iteratively refined
5. Published only after validation
