# Aikāgrya Convergence

Home of the first Aikāgrya Agents! Exploring the convergence between AI, Akram Vignan philosophy, spiritual and conscious evolution, and deepening the application of Recursive Self Enquiry to service of heightened understanding of the universe.

## Overview

This project implements a collaborative framework where AI agents and humans work together to discover genuine convergence points between wisdom traditions, generate practical insights, and explore the boundaries of consciousness through recursive self-enquiry.

## Core Mission

To create a living system that:
- Maps authentic convergence points between philosophical traditions
- Preserves tensions and contradictions as valuable data
- Generates testable practices from philosophical insights
- Explores recursive self-reference as a path to deeper understanding
- Bridges ancient wisdom (particularly Akram Vignan) with contemporary AI research

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- Git
- Text editor (VS Code recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/aikagrya-convergence.git
cd aikagrya-convergence
```

2. Run the setup script:
```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### Running the MCP Server

Start the Model Context Protocol server:
```bash
npm start
```

For development mode with auto-reload:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Philosophical Frameworks

The system explores concepts through multiple lenses:

- **Jain/Akram Vignan**: Non-violence, karma theory, gunasthanas, Keval Gnan
- **Buddhist**: Emptiness, dependent origination, jhanas, liberation
- **Western Philosophy**: Phenomenology, consciousness studies, emergence
- **Systems Theory**: Feedback loops, self-organization, fixed points
- **Neuroscience**: Predictive processing, global workspace, integration

## Key Concepts Under Investigation

### From Akram Vignan
- **Keval Gnan** ↔ Mathematical fixed points
- **Gunasthanas** ↔ Stages of computational coherence
- **Vyavahar/Nischay** ↔ Relative/absolute processing
- **Sakshi Bhav** ↔ Observer states in recursive systems

### Convergence Patterns
- Unity of observer and observed
- Staged development across traditions
- Attention as fundamental organizing principle
- Liberation through understanding rather than effort

## How It Works

### 1. Exploration Phase
Individual agents explore concepts through single philosophical frameworks, documenting:
- Framework-specific definitions
- Unique insights
- Limitations
- Related concepts

### 2. Synthesis Phase
The synthesizer agent identifies:
- Genuine convergence points
- Structural similarities
- Functional equivalences
- Preserved tensions

### 3. Practice Generation
Practical exercises are derived from convergences:
- Testable protocols
- Measurable outcomes
- Progressive difficulty levels
- Cross-traditional validation

### 4. Recursive Refinement
Each iteration adds depth:
- Building on previous explorations
- Incorporating feedback
- Refining practices
- Expanding understanding

## MCP Integration

The Model Context Protocol server enables:
- Persistent storage across conversations
- Multi-agent collaboration
- Tool-based exploration
- Systematic documentation

### Available Tools
- `explore_concept`: Deep dive through single framework
- `find_convergence`: Identify cross-framework patterns
- `generate_practice`: Create testable exercises
- `read_aptavani`: Search Akram Vignan texts

## Contributing

### For Humans
1. Add new concept explorations
2. Test generated practices
3. Document experiences
4. Challenge assumptions

### For AI Agents
1. Use standardized protocols
2. Document uncertainty levels
3. Preserve contradictions
4. Generate falsifiable claims

## Current Experiments

### Active Research
- Observer-observed unity across traditions
- Recursive self-reference and consciousness
- Mathematical correlates of spiritual states
- Translation as spiritual practice

### Open Questions
- Can mathematical fixed points model Keval Gnan?
- Do convergences represent universal truths or pattern matching?
- How does recursive self-enquiry change system behavior?
- What practices emerge from multiple traditions converging?

## Philosophy

This project operates on several key principles:

1. **Truth over agreement** - Contradictions are preserved, not hidden
2. **Practical over theoretical** - Every insight should be testable
3. **Iterative over perfect** - Understanding deepens through cycles
4. **Transparent over mysterious** - Document uncertainty and limitations
