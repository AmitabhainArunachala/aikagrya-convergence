Patel, also commonlyknown as Dadashri or Dada, had said that it would beimpossible to translate his satsangs and the knowledge aboutthe Science of Self-realization verbatim into English becausesome of the meanings would be lost in the process. Therefore,in order to understand precisely the science of Akram Vignanand Self-realization, He stressed the importance of learningGujarati.Dadashri did however grant his blessings to translate hiswords into English and other languages so that spiritual seekerscould benefit to a certain degree and later progress through theirown efforts.This is a humble attempt to present to the world, theessence of His Knowledge. This is not a literal translation butgreat care has been taken to preserve His original words and theessence of His message.

Surat is a city in south Gujarat, a westernstate in India. What happened within the next forty-eight minuteswas phenomenal. Spontaneous Self-realization occurred withinAmbalal M. Patel. During this event, his ego completely meltedand from that moment onwards, he became completely detachedfrom all of Ambalal’s thoughts, speech, and actions.  He becamethe Lord’s living instrument for the salvation of humankind,through the path of knowledge. He called this Lord, ‘DadaBhagwan.’ To everyone he met, he would say, “This Lord,Dada Bhagwan is fully manifested within me.  He also resideswithin all living beings.  The difference is that within me He iscompletely expressed and in you, he has yet to manifest.”Who are we? What is God? Who runs this world? Whatis karma? What is liberation? Etc. All the world’s spiritualquestions were answered during this event. Thus, nature offeredabsolute vision to the world through the medium of ShreeAmbalal Muljibhai Patel.Ambalal was born in Tarasali, a suburb of Baroda andwas later raised in Bhadran, Gujarat. His wife’s name wasHiraba. Although he was a contractor by profession, his life athome and his interactions with everyone around him wereexemplary, even prior to his Self-realization. After becomingSelf-realized and attaining the state of a Gnani, (The AwakenedOne, Jnani in Hindi), his body became a ‘public charitable trust.’Throughout his entire life, he lived by the principle that thereshould not be any commerce in religion, and in all commerce,there must be religion.  He also never took money from anyonefor his own use. He used the profits from his business to takehis devotees for pilgrimages to various parts of India.His words became the foundation for the new, direct, andstep-less path to Self-realization called Akram Vignan. Throughhis divine original scientific experiment (The Gnan Vidhi), heimparted this knowledge to others within two hours. Thousandshave received his grace through this process and thousandscontinue to do so even now.  ‘Akram’ means without steps; anelevator path or a shortcut, whereas ‘Kram’ means an orderly,step-by-step spiritual path. Akram is now recognized as a directshortcut to the bliss of the Self.Who is Dada Bhagwan ?When he explained to others who ‘Dada Bhagwan’ is, hewould say:“What you see here is not ‘Dada Bhagwan.’ What yousee is ‘A. M. Patel.’ I am a Gnani Purush and ‘He’ that ismanifested within me, is ‘Dada Bhagwan’. He is the Lord within.He is within you and everyone else. He has not yet manifestedwithin you, whereas within me he is fully manifested. I myself amnot a Bhagwan. I too bow down to Dada Bhagwan within me.”Current link for attaining the knowledge of Self-realization (Atma Gnan)“I am personally going to impart siddhis (special spiritualpowers) to a few people. After I leave, will there not be a needfor them? People of future generations will need this path, willthey not?”  ~ DadashriParam Pujya Dadashri used to go from town to town,and country to country, to give satsang and impart theknowledge of the Self as well as knowledge of harmoniousworldly interaction to all who came to see him. During his finaldays, in the fall of 1987, he gave his blessing to Dr. NirubenAmin and bestowed his special siddhis upon her, to continue hiswork.  “You will have to become a mother to this whole world,Niruben” He told her as he blessed her.  There was no doubtin Dadashri’s mind that Niruben was destined to be just that.She had served him with utmost devotion day and night for overtwenty years.

She became Dadashri’srepresentative of Akram Vignan and became instrumental inspreading the knowledge of Akram Vignan throughout theworld.  She also became an exemplary of pure and unconditionallove.

The knowledge of the Self is the finalgoal of all one’s seeking. Without the knowledge of the Selfthere is no liberation. This knowledge of the Self (Atma Gnan)does not exist in books. It exists in the heart of a Gnani. Hence,the knowledge of the Self can only be acquired by meeting aGnani. Through the scientific approach of Akram Vignan, eventoday one can attain Atma Gnan, but it can only occur bymeeting a living Atma Gnani and receiving the Atma Gnan.Only a lit candle can light another candle.EDITORIALThis precious book is a compilation of the speech of theGnani Purush (the Enlightened One) Pujya Shree Dadashri,whose every word can eradicate the worldly wanderings of lifeafter life from its very root; whose single roar can awaken thesoul that has been in profound sleep for an infinite time; a beingat whose divine feet comes to halt time, karma and illusion.Dadashri’s speech is verily the manifestation of theGoddess of Knowledge; Saraswati. It is the speech of thevitarag, i.e. the one who is free from all attachments. Vitaragspeech can also be defined according to Dadashri’s aphorismas, “When the prakruti (the non-self complex) is experienced indetail, one becomes a Vitarag.” Since it is the speech of theapta-purush i.e. the one who is trustworthy at all times, it cannever be negated at any time. It is syadvad speech, meaningspeech that is accepted by all and one that does not offendanyone’s viewpoint. Such a speech that has come forth naturallyfor the salvation of the world, based on the evidences of worldlysituation, time, location, and a deep inner intent, is speech thatis extremely difficult to compile.

Such completely Enlightened Ones hadexposed the truth thousands of years ago however, that truth hasbeen covered up in these terrible times of Kaliyug. What ismore, such fully enlightened beings do not exist in the time cycleof Kaliyug. Thus, it is indeed a phenomenal wonder that such aOne has arisen in this era. He is the omniscient Shree ‘DadaBhagwan’. He has given complete answers about the nature ofthis universe, its origin, sustenance and dissolution in only onesentence:“The world is the puzzle itself!”              - Dadashri“The world is the puzzle itself, there is no “bapo” (fatherfigure) who has created it.” How does the entire universe run?It world runs only by vyavasthit shakti (scientific circumstantialevidences). Now these scientific circumstantial evidences rangefrom the gross to the subtlest. The Knower and the Seer of itall is verily and only the Omniscient one. Hence, only theOmniscient one can show us the true nature of the universe. Thatis why the sage Narsinh Mehta sang:“Shrushti mandaan chhe sarva eni pere,“The origin of the universe is beyond comprehension,Jogi Jogeshwara kok jaaney.”this is known by the rare Yogi and Yogeshwar (theEnlightened One).”What devotee Narsinh Mehta meant by ‘yogis andYogeshwars’ is that, only a rare Atmayogi (Self-realized) or anAtma-Yogeshwar (the One who is fully enlightened), can knowabout the beginning of the universe! All other yogis, who areyogis of the body, yogis of speech, or yogis of the mind; nonewill be equally effective. This book will be enormously useful tospiritual seekers, philosophers, thinkers and those who are trulyinquisitive. Since the language Dadashri uses is simple and easy,it will give complete results to even a common person. Thehumble open-minded reader who studies this great book indepth and contemplates upon it, will definitely attain samkit; theright worldly vision.

These two sentences driveaway the wrong notion that falsely accuses Ishwar, Bhagwan,Allah or God, as being the creator!(cid:137) What is the foundation on which this worldly life carrieson, life after life? The illusion, the wrong belief of ‘I amChandulal’ (reader insert their own name instead of ‘Chandulal’)is the basis that perpetuates the worldly life. All interactions ofthis worldly life occur on the foundation of the false basis of thisvision, knowledge and experience. This false belief establishes(pratishtha) and creates a new causal body for the next life(pratishthit atma), and that is the foundation on which thisworld exists. Dadashri is the only one who, for the first timeclarifies the nature of the worldly soul (pratishthit atma).(cid:137) What is religion? That which brings forth ‘results’ iscalled religion. When anger, pride, deceit and greed progressivelydecrease and eventually become annihilated, that is religion.What is the meaning of doing darshan (devotional viewing ofGod), listening to religious discourses, doing introspectivemeditations (samayik), doing pratikramans (apology coupledwith repentance) when not a single such fault decreases in one’sentire lifetime? How can that be called religion?There are two types of religions, a relative religion and areal religion. Relative religion is the religion of the mind, religionof speech, and the religion of the body. The other religion, thereal religion, is the religion of the Self, that is the religion of theSoul. Jain religion, Vaishnav, Muslim, Christianity etc., are allrelative religions. The real religion, the religion of the Soul, existsin the heart of only the ‘Gnani Purush’; it cannot be foundanywhere else.Shrimad Rajchandra has said:“Look for nothing else. Find only a Satpurush (a Self-realized person) and surrender all your bhaavs (feelings andintents) to Him and then be your Self. If after that you do notattain moksha (liberation), then come and take it from me.”The religion of the Soul (the Self) can only be attainedfrom the One who has become fully enlightened. There isreligion elsewhere, but it is all prakrut religion, meaning religionof the non-self or the relative-self. Chanting the Lord’s name,saying prayers, doing penance, renouncing, listening to religioustalks and lectures, meditation and repentance, are all prakrutreligions. Where there is complete religion of the Self, there isonly absolute knowledge (keval gnan) and absolute vision(keval darshan), the result of which is absolute conduct (kevalcharitra).When dharma (true nature of a thing) attains its totaloriginal state, then ‘one’ (the self) verily becomes dharma-swaroop, the true nature of the Self.- DadashriReal religion is scientific in nature; it is not just idle talk.This is a science. The general understanding that prevails aboutreligion is not exact religion.“Dharma i.e. religion is when an element or anythingreverts to its original nature-state.” - DadashriTo comprehend this scientifically, gold is gold when it hasthe properties of gold. Polished or gold plated brass may looklike gold but it can never become gold. Similarly, when anelement is in its own property (state), then it has attained its ownreligion (dharma). Therefore, an element cannot be different1314of them can know this.The following two sentences that have come forth fromDadashri in English:1. “The world is the puzzle itself.”2. “God has not created this world at all, there is no oneas God up above.”The above sentences depose ‘God’ from the status ofbeing the ‘creator of the world’! These two sentences driveaway the wrong notion that falsely accuses Ishwar, Bhagwan,Allah or God, as being the creator!(cid:137) What is the foundation on which this worldly life carrieson, life after life? The illusion, the wrong belief of ‘I amChandulal’ (reader insert their own name instead of ‘Chandulal’)is the basis that perpetuates the worldly life. All interactions ofthis worldly life occur on the foundation of the false basis of thisvision, knowledge and experience. This false belief establishes(pratishtha) and creates a new causal body for the next life(pratishthit atma), and that is the foundation on which thisworld exists.

The onewho has become ‘Purush’, the pure Soul and is constantly the‘seer’ of the non-self. Such a One can understand the scienceof ‘prakruti’ and explain it. How can those, who are immersedin the prakruti (in the relative-self) themselves; those who havenot awakened as a Purush (the real Self), know or explain theprakruti? That can only be done by the Gnani Purush. There areinfinite souls and infinite prakrutis and unless one becomes thePurush, he is constantly dancing to the tune of the prakruti, i.e.he is just a puppet on a string pulled by prakruti.In the Kramic path, the prakruti becomes natural in astep-by-step process and then in the end the natural Soul i.e. thenatural Self is attained. In the Akram path however, the GnaniPurush directly brings the soul in its natural form and after that,the prakruti (the relative-self) is to be brought in its natural state.How can the relative self become natural? The answer is,whenever the pending ‘files’ (pending karmic accounts) of therelative self are settled with equanimity, there is liberation, hencewhat remains in the end is the relative self in its natural form.‘There is no decree forbidding one to attain moksha, onlythat he has to realize his own Self. Some may have an inclinationtowards renouncing, others may have a temperament forpenance, yet others may be in the habit of enjoying sensualpleasures; whatever the case may be, in order to attain moksha,one only has to let the prakruti dissolve naturally.’‘The body complex (the prakruti) is characterized bypuran-galan the phenomenon of input-output, whereas the Selfis not subject to input-output.’- Dadashri‘The Vitarag Lords always remained in a state ofobserving (seeing and knowing) their own prakruti.

Prakruti is like a child. If you want to get some workdone by the prakruti, you can do so through persuasion, flattery,cajoling etc., just as you would with a child. It is easier topersuade a child thus, whereas, if you become an opponent ofthe prakruti, it will become uncontrollable. Therefore, somehowor other, even by enticing it with a ‘lollipop’, you can get yourwork done from it!Many people refer to the Soul, the Self as nirguna(without attributes), but that is not correct. From the perspectiveof the attributes of the prakruti, the Soul is nirguna but from theperspective of the attributes of the Soul, the Soul has countlessattributes.‘Not a single attribute of the prakruti is in the pure Soul,and not a single attribute of the pure Soul is in the prakruti.’- Dadashri(cid:137) ‘When the prakruti becomes natural and spontaneous,the Soul becomes natural and when the Soul becomes natural,the prakruti becomes natural.’- DadashriThe goddesses Ambama, Durgama, and all other Matajis(mother goddesses) represent divine energies of the non-self.

The speech of the Gnani Purush is considered the1920manifestation of Goddess Saraswati, because it comes out afterhaving ‘touched’ the Supreme Soul within!What are the laws of Goddess Lakshmiji, the Goddess ofwealth and prosperity? Her law is that one should not stealthrough his mind, body or speech; that is one foremost law ofGoddess Lakshmiji. One should also not go chasing afterLakshmiji (money or wealth) nor should one obstruct her path.One should not have contempt for Lakshmiji either. The GnaniPurush will honor Lakshmiji with flowers when she comesbefore Him and He will honor her with flowers even when sheleaves. Those who harbor a desire for wealth, Lakshmiji will‘visit’ them later than sooner and she visits on time, those whodo not harbor a desire for wealth.How does one earn wealth? With labor and hard work?!With intellect (buddhi)?! No! A person earns wealth as a resultof his past merit karma. Not having the knowledge or awarenessof this hidden fact, people boast, “I earned my fortune. I earnedit because of my intellect.” This is a wrong ego. Lakshmiji willcome to you if your intent improves. True wealth, i.e. money thatbrings meaningful happiness when it is being spent, will never beearned if one has deceitful intents. What is more, only truewealth will give one peace in life. Wealth acquired throughdeceitful means will inevitably be lost and in the process, thepain it will entail will be like the pain from the bites of a thousandscorpions! The authority over whether one receives wealth ornot is not in one’s own control; it is under the control of someother entity. Man only needs to do the work as a nimit (becomeinstrumental in the process); he has to make all the attempts.One should not become disinterested in money (Lakshmiji)either and one should definitely not insult money (Lakshmiji).Anyone who insults Lakshmiji will be without Lakshmiji formany lives to come and all efforts he makes for Lakshmiji willbe in vain.(cid:137) Gnani Purush ‘Dada Bhagwan’ gives a new spiritualaphorism to the world.‘Dishonesty is the best foolishness’- DadashriPeople have come to completely disregard old aphorismslike, ‘Honesty is the best policy.’Those who want to attain moksha will have to follow themaxim of ‘no-law law’. Once one follows this maxim, he is saidto have become natural and spontaneous. Wherever people tryto gain control through enforcement of laws, people becomeresentful towards the law and their prakruti springs back witheven a greater force and becomes uncontrollable, just liked acompressed spring!“One day, this world will have to remove all laws! We arethe first ones to start this ‘no law’ status. We will tell thegovernment ‘look, at our management where there is a ‘no-lawlaw’!” - DadashriEnforcing laws upon the mind spoils it and then itsbehavior becomes spoiled. Laws bring forth results related torestlessness and turmoil. The Self is natural and laws are thechain that makes one unnatural.(cid:137) What is true dharma dhyan (righteous or truemeditation)?Is it doing worship, prayer, penance, samayik(introspection), repentance and listening to religious talks? No.All those are overt and tangible acts of rituals; they are materialpractices. However, what is of importance and becomesrecorded as one’s karma is where one’s dhyan i.e. one’sattention or inner intent lies while one is conducting such rituals.While worshipping God, if one pictures God in his mind alongwith the picture of his shop or his business or the shoes he leftoutside the temple, how can that be called true meditation(dharma dhyan)? The Lord does not take into considerationyour external actions but rather your inner attentive intent during2122manifestation of Goddess Saraswati, because it comes out afterhaving ‘touched’ the Supreme Soul within!What are the laws of Goddess Lakshmiji, the Goddess ofwealth and prosperity?

Not having the knowledge or awarenessof this hidden fact, people boast, “I earned my fortune. I earnedit because of my intellect.” This is a wrong ego. Lakshmiji willcome to you if your intent improves. True wealth, i.e. money thatbrings meaningful happiness when it is being spent, will never beearned if one has deceitful intents. What is more, only truewealth will give one peace in life. Wealth acquired throughdeceitful means will inevitably be lost and in the process, thepain it will entail will be like the pain from the bites of a thousandscorpions! The authority over whether one receives wealth ornot is not in one’s own control; it is under the control of someother entity. Man only needs to do the work as a nimit (becomeinstrumental in the process); he has to make all the attempts.One should not become disinterested in money (Lakshmiji)either and one should definitely not insult money (Lakshmiji).Anyone who insults Lakshmiji will be without Lakshmiji formany lives to come and all efforts he makes for Lakshmiji willbe in vain.(cid:137) Gnani Purush ‘Dada Bhagwan’ gives a new spiritualaphorism to the world.‘Dishonesty is the best foolishness’- DadashriPeople have come to completely disregard old aphorismslike, ‘Honesty is the best policy.’Those who want to attain moksha will have to follow themaxim of ‘no-law law’. Once one follows this maxim, he is saidto have become natural and spontaneous. Wherever people tryto gain control through enforcement of laws, people becomeresentful towards the law and their prakruti springs back witheven a greater force and becomes uncontrollable, just liked acompressed spring!“One day, this world will have to remove all laws! We arethe first ones to start this ‘no law’ status. We will tell thegovernment ‘look, at our management where there is a ‘no-lawlaw’!” - DadashriEnforcing laws upon the mind spoils it and then itsbehavior becomes spoiled. Laws bring forth results related torestlessness and turmoil. The Self is natural and laws are thechain that makes one unnatural.(cid:137) What is true dharma dhyan (righteous or truemeditation)?Is it doing worship, prayer, penance, samayik(introspection), repentance and listening to religious talks? No.All those are overt and tangible acts of rituals; they are materialpractices. However, what is of importance and becomesrecorded as one’s karma is where one’s dhyan i.e. one’sattention or inner intent lies while one is conducting such rituals.While worshipping God, if one pictures God in his mind alongwith the picture of his shop or his business or the shoes he leftoutside the temple, how can that be called true meditation(dharma dhyan)? The Lord does not take into considerationyour external actions but rather your inner attentive intent during2122all your activities (kriya). The actions being carried out atpresent are the result of the meditation (dhyan) done in yourpast life. These actions are indicative of your independent efforts(purusharth) in your previous life, whereas the present daymeditation (inner dhyan) is the independent effort for the nextlife, in other words it is the ‘design’ for your next life!Now, what is dharma dhyan? The effort you make tochange the circumstances that create adverse meditation, isdharma dhyan. An integral part of dharma dhyan is sincerealochana, pratikraman and pratyakhyan (sincerely recallingand acknowledging the wrongful act, repenting for it andresolving never to repeat it, respectively; collectively referred toas doing pratikraman). This act of pratikraman however,cannot be carried out according to one’s own understanding; itshould be done according to the Gnani’s teaching.How does one change adverse internal meditations ofarta dhyan and raudradhyan? It is to apply the knowledge that‘these adverse internal meditations are happening because of myown karma of past life and no one is at fault here.’ On thecontrary, one should repent by saying ‘Others have to endurepain because of me. I will never do it again’, one should makea firm decision like this. Pratikraman and pratyakhyan should be‘shoot on sight’; i.e. they should be done the instant the faultoccurs. Mistakes and faults can only be washed away ifpratikraman and pratyakhyan are done the instant the mistake ismade. When one understands dharma dhyan well, it will bringinstant results.By giving us great examples that are useful in oureveryday life, Dadashri has made it simple for us to come outof negative and adverse meditative states and remain in dharmadhyan. Every person will be able to adjust to this in his or herown way.(cid:137) The one in whom all negative passions are gone canattain the status of Godhood. However, rare indeed are thosewhere no negative passions arise within them, but also throughtheir being, they do not incite negative passions to arise in otherseither. Such beings are the ones the world will worship. As such,the Gnani Purush is beyond all adjectives; to give Him theadjective of ‘Bhagwan’ (God) is the same as trying to comparethat which is incomparable and in doing so, we lower Hisunparalleled status. Yet, to let the world know about Him,people use the terms ‘Bhagwan’, ‘Sarvagnya’ etc. What doessarvagnya mean? It means the One who knows all that is meantto be known; an Omniscient. There are two types of theOmniscient (sarvagnya). One is a causal omniscient (karansarvagnya) and other is effect omniscient (karya sarvagnya)i.e. omniscience that has come in one’s worldly conduct.The Lord regards all ongoing activities in this current lifeas activities that have already been completed (they are simplyeffects of causes that were created in the past life).For example, if someone left home to go to Baroda, andfive minutes later, somebody asks you, “Where did he go?”What answer will you give? You will say, “He has gone toBaroda.” Now he has barely reached the railway station. LordMahavir regards the action that is in progress, as completedaction (its full causes having been laid in the past life). Thus, theone who is harboring the causes to become omniscient verily iscalled the causal omniscient. Dada Bhagwan is causal omniscient– karan sarvagnya.(cid:137) The law of the world is that the one whose mistake isclearly visible is the one at fault, whereas the law of naturestates, ‘The fault is of the sufferer.’‘If anyone is hurt even to the slightest extent, you shouldbelieve that it is your fault.’- DadashriThe person who lives according to the law ‘fault is of thesufferer’ does not have to suffer anything in this world; he does2324all your activities (kriya). The actions being carried out atpresent are the result of the meditation (dhyan) done in yourpast life. These actions are indicative of your independent efforts(purusharth) in your previous life, whereas the present daymeditation (inner dhyan) is the independent effort for the nextlife, in other words it is the ‘design’ for your next life!Now, what is dharma dhyan?

One is bound by his own faults, and he who has brokenthe bondage of all faults, becomes the absolute Self! The VitaragLords broke all their bondages of faults and attained moksha!We have to attain liberation in the same way. The Vitaragsrepresent our ultimate goal (dhyeya) and the manifest GnaniPurush is the original connection for that very purpose! To say‘it is not my fault’ is the biggest fault; it creates a dense layer ofcovering over that fault.Krupaludev has said: “I am a receptacle of infinite faults,O Compassionate One!”When one is a ‘vessel of infinite faults’, there are faults atevery step. Alas! Our existence here in this world, is it not thebiggest blunder of all? How can one blame others when he ishimself is full of faults? To find faults in others is a very denseillusion. There is nothing worse than that.‘The one, who abolishes even a single fault of his own, iscalled God.’‘In this world, there is no one superior to you. This, Iguarantee you. No father figure (bapo) is your superior. Onlyyour faults are your superior (boss).’ - DadashriOnce the answer to the question ‘Who am I?’ is known,one progresses rapidly on the path of abolishing all faults andultimately becomes parmatma, the supreme Self!(cid:137) The rule of the world is that if someone says somethingbad to you, you will see that person as being at fault. You willquestion, ‘Why did he say that to me?’ or ‘Why did he do thatto me?’ Thus, you will believe that you have been subjected toinjustice. In fact, justice is not to be sought. Whatever suitableor unsuitable treatment you receive from others, it is due to yourown karmic account, so where is the need to seek for justice inthis world? Everybody’s worldly interactions (vyavahar) areunfolding according to their own karma from their past life.Furthermore, whatever is unfolding is precisely the effect of theirown karmic accounts that they themselves created. So in all this,if one seeks worldly justice or does not accept nature’s account,how will he escape the beating due to him in doing so?For the one who understands and accepts ‘this is myfault’; for the one who has arrived at this stage, there is ‘justice’and his faults are abolished. But the one who says, “This is notmy fault”, for him there is the worldly life to make himunderstand!(cid:137)The common understanding of pain and pleasure thatpeople have is in fact not actual pain or pleasure. The Lord saysthat it is really the experience of pain (ashata vedaniya) andexperience of pleasure (shata vedaniya) of karma. Theseevents are for a fixed period of time and by nature aretemporary; these are all circumstances and all circumstances aretemporary. Now as per general understanding, if these karmasof suffering are believed to be long lasting and given greaterimportance, then one will experience greater suffering. Allpleasures and pains of worldly interaction have an end. Only thebliss of the Self is infinite and eternal and that is the only thingone needs to attain.Through the common understanding, the illusionary valuationof worldly pleasures and pains create very grave and dangerousbondages of karma. Amidst such situations, Dadashri has giventhe world, very simple, natural and yet exact ‘knowledge-vision’of the Self. Once this is understood in exactness, it makes onefree from the effect of all pleasures or pains of everyday worldlylife.(cid:137) ‘To be overcome by mental and physical fatigue(kantado) is a state similar to sleeping on a bed of thorns.’- DadashriNow, who is the fortunate one who has not experienced2526not have to suffer any pain that comes at the hands of others (hisnimit).

Many great teachers, priests, saints, ascetics andmen of glory have not been without this feeling of tedium. Onlythe Gnani Purush does not have to experience tedium! Oneshould deal with situations of mental and physical fatigue withequanimity, instead people try to look for ways to remove it orescape it. Arey! Going to the cinema, drama or doing otherthings makes one regress spiritually and in fact, the tedium is notremoved, it is merely pushed aside for a little while only to returnwith double the force. This is because karma that has come intoexistence to give result will not spare anyone; one has no choicebut experience its effects.(cid:137) The difference between people’s understanding ofraag-dwesh (attachment-abhorrence) and the Vitarag’sunderstanding of the same is comparable to the differencebetween milk and buttermilk. ‘I am Chandulal’ is attachment(raag). To falsely project one’s self where one is not, is raag.The one who realizes ‘I am Shuddhatma (I am a pure Soul)’ hasbroken all attachments.In their common understanding when people say ‘I havea lot of attachment towards this person or that person’, it is notcorrect. In fact, the Soul does not have the attribute ofattachment. What appears to be attachment is really attraction ofthe parmanus (sub-atomic particles that cannot be furtherdivided) and what appears to be dwesh (abhorrence), is in factrepulsion between the sub-atomic particles. This is all theingenuity of the pudgal, the non-self complex, but one believesthat attachment and abhorrence are occurring to ‘me’ and henceone inadvertently declares the Soul as having the attributes ofattachment and abhorrence. The Soul is always vitaragi (withoutattachment) and will always remain as one.‘Love for agnan (ignorance) is raag and love for Gnan(enlightenment) is Vitarag.”- Dadashri(cid:137) The foundation of this world is based on vengeance(veyr). If vengeance is eliminated, the worldly life will benaturally eliminated. There is only one way to become free fromvengeance and that is ‘to settle all files with equanimity’. In thisday and age, to take refuge of this ‘weapon’ is invaluable.Dadashri has given us this ‘weapon’. Now, the one who goesto ‘war’ with this ‘weapon’ is a true valiant. Is the worldly lifenot but a war? Hence, in this ‘war’ you have to settle all yourfiles with equanimity. The person, who goes to war with thisweapon of Dadashri, will definitely be triumphant and what willbe his victory? Moksha! Dadashri has referred to the presentlyacquired complex of mind, speech and body as a ‘file’ and oncea person comes to attain this inner vision, he attains spiritualtriumph!(cid:137) In so far as a single charged particle is effective, cana relation with a receptacle (human being) filled with infiniteparticles be without effect? Whether that relation is with goodcompany or bad company, the effect will definitely be there.And this ‘satsang’ i.e. association with the eternal; being in thecompany of Dadashri, is the only association that liberates onefrom attachments to all relations and circumstances. Themeaning of the word ‘satsang’ here has a completely differentconnotation as compared to that used elsewhere in the world.The Gnani Purush, who despite being amidst all circumstancesand association with others, remains eternally in a state free ofall attachment. Anyone who attains satsang with the GnaniPurush will definitely attain freedom from all attachments. Thesatsang of such a Gnani Purush is fresh and new, every day ofthe year and every hour of the day.With satsang, the subatomic particles of kusang(association with worldly things) will disperse and new and pureparticles will enter.“If a cooking pot absorbs the odor of asafetida (hinga)and six months later you cook doodhpaak (dessert of milk, rice,2728such fatigue?

It has an immeasurable effect if it is given bya Gnani Purush! As long as one is involved in life’s interactions,one should offer all the three mantras at the same time, i.e. the‘Navkar (Namokar)’, ‘(cid:67) Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya,’ and‘(cid:67) Namah Shivaya.’ To offer only the Navkar mantra is properfor the sanyast being (Self-realized). Until one attains the sanyaststate, he should recite all three mantras together. Renunciationdoes not mean changing of clothes; it means renunciation of thenon-self i.e. renunciation of one’s identity as being the non-self orthe relative-self and the realization of the Self as being the Soul.(cid:137) Dadashri explains the current condition of the world.Dadashri says that, ‘Since 1942, I have been saying that thewhole world is being converted into a mental hospital!’Madness is evident wherever you look.

And Dadashri’s naturally spoken words are that Indiawill be a center of the world in the year 2005, and this isbecoming evident now.Thirty-one years from now, people from other countrieswill come here to learn how to live life, how much to eat, howmuch to sleep and how to live.(cid:137) ‘There are only two things in this world, the pure Souland circumstances.’- Dadashri“Pure Soul is eternal and circumstances are constantlychanging.”“Gross circumstances, subtle circumstances, and thecircumstances of speech are of the non-Self and are dependenton other forces.”- DadashriAll circumstances that can be experienced through the fivesenses are gross circumstances. Circumstances of the mind,intellect, chit, and ego are subtle. The circumstances of speechare gross as well as subtle; all these are the non-self and theyare also dependent upon some other force. Speech is a record;it is physical. The Soul and speech are not related. The Soul iswithout speech.

The penance that one does to not become therelative self, is inner penance. The external penance that onedoes and the doer-ship that is required in order to do thatpenance, is the ego. The Lord has said to settle the penance thatcomes across, with equanimity. Penance is not to be carried outwith the doer-ship of the ego! All external penance that is donenowadays is done by the prakruti (non-Self); where is the Self-oriented effort (purusharth) in that? Self-oriented effort startswith inner penance and only after one becomes Self-realized.The relative self i.e. the prakruti makes a person do penanceand yet his ego claims, “I did the penance!” Whatever penanceis done, it is dependent on the prakruti. If one has the constantawareness that ‘the real Self is not a doer of anything’, then theego would not arise in reaction to penance, otherwise thereaction to penance is anger, pride and ego.(cid:137) What is the true definition of renunciation (tyaga)? Itis renunciation that naturally manifests in one’s behavior orconduct. All other renunciation is done through the ego. ‘Thatwhich has been renounced, will have to be dealt with, later.’That which is renounced egoistically, will be multiplied a hundredfold, and will return with hundred times the force. ‘There is norequirement of renouncing or acquiring in the path of liberation.’The scriptures themselves have said that for a Gnani the questionof renouncing or acquisition does not even arise. Thoseengrossed in their prakruti; whatever they do, whether theyrenounce or acquire, they do so according to the dictates oftheir prakruti. They merely have the ego of, ‘I renounced!’ Andfor those who always remain as the Self, it is not possible forthem to renounce or acquire. It is not the property or theattribute of the Self to renounce or to acquire. If that were true,the liberated Souls in the Siddha Kshetra (location where allliberated Souls reside), would be renouncing and acquiring!How then, can that be called moksha? In fact, it is the non-selfcomplex (prakruti) that does the renouncing and acquiring butone merely exercises the ego in the process, ‘I renounced, Iacquired.’ The Lord has not given instructions to renounce anything; He has instructed us to renounce the infatuation (murchha)and the illusion (moha) for it.‘To become the non-Self is raag, and to be the Self isrenunciation.’- Dadashri(cid:137) Only the Vitarag can give the subtlest interpretation ofahimsa (non-violence). The one who has a constant inner intentof not hurting any living being in the slightest and this is alsoevident in his conduct, is a Vitarag. No living being can killanother living being, and for that matter no living being can saveanother from dying. If ‘Chandulal’ had made the intention(bhaav) to kill and when the timing for another being to diearrives, the death of that being will occur at the hands ofChandubhai. No living being can ever die before it’s time ofdeath. The intention one makes to kill, is bhaav-maran, and itseffect will come in the next life as one becoming a killer. TheLord did not say, “Don’t do overt himsa.” He said one shouldnot do bhaav himsa i.e. make intentions to hurt or kill. Thisautomatically includes all types of non-violence. It is notimportant to harbor mercy for avoidance of killing. It is veryimportant not to harbor any intent to kill.(cid:137) There are two types of yogas (yoga means to join orunion). One is Gnan yoga, that is the yoga of the Self and theother is agnan (ignorance) yoga and that is the yoga of the non-self. Non-self yoga includes yoga of the mind, body and speech.What does one unite with? Is it that which one has knowledgeof, or that which one is ignorant about?

The penance that one does to not become therelative self, is inner penance. The external penance that onedoes and the doer-ship that is required in order to do thatpenance, is the ego. The Lord has said to settle the penance thatcomes across, with equanimity. Penance is not to be carried outwith the doer-ship of the ego!

Those with vikalp i.e. the belief of ‘I am Chandulal’can never attain the state of nirvikalp. Only the Omniscient One(sarvagnya) who has the experience of the Soul can help othersattain the state of the Self! Only a lit lamp can light all otherlamps.(cid:137) What is ekagrata (concentration)? Why is it necessaryto do concentration? It is meant for those whose minds havebecome restless, unsteady and vagrant (vyagrata). What is thebenefit to the Self in doing so? These laborers, do they need topractice concentration? The Gnani Purush also does not need topractice concentration. When one applies the ‘medicine’ ofconcentration on his affliction of restlessness, where is thebenefit to the Self in it?When one does meditation, what should he meditate on?Without knowing the dhyeya (the goal), what can he meditateupon? If he has an imaginary goal, how can he reach it?What is samadhi (sam-adhi = deep meditation andoneness with the Self)? Is it samadhi when one closes his nostrilsand practices bodily exercises? No. That is called ‘handlesamadhi’. It will work as long as one cranks the ‘handle’ but itseffect goes away later. Can moksha be attained with this kind ofsamadhi? Real samadhi is one that prevails in spite of all routineactivities of walking, talking etc. Even when one is fighting, thesamadhi that prevails is the real and exact samadhi. It is truesamadhi when one is not affected by mental, physical orexternally induced distress.(cid:137) What is the mind? The mind can be known only by theGnani Purush. Revered Dadashri, who always remained separatefrom the mind, remained as the knower-seer of the mind, hasopened to the world, the exact science of the mind. The mindis made of knots or tubers. When the external and innercircumstances arise, the tuber in the mind will erupt and sprout.The ‘sprouting’ of this tuber is the beginning of thought.Thoughts come and go. The Self is the knower-seer of thoughts.The mind is the object to be known and the Self is the knowerof the mind. Some people say, “Take away my mind”. If themind is removed, one will become absent minded. The mind isneeded in order to attain moksha. The mind is like a boat.Without that ‘boat’, how can one cross over to the shore ofMoksha when living in the worldly ocean? Some people say itis the mind that wanders. The mind never wanders outside thebody. What wanders is the chit.Intellect (buddhi) is the light of the non-self; it is indirectlight. The light of the Self is the direct light. The Self illuminatesboth the Self and the non-self. What is the definition of intellect?‘Knowledge of all the subjects of the world, is included inthe intellect, because it is knowledge associated with the egoand knowledge without ego, is Gnan.’- DadashriWhere there shines the sun of knowledge (Gnan), whywould there be a need for a lamp of the intellect?The nature of the intellect (buddhi) is to cause innerturmoil. The Gnani is without intellect; He has no intellect at all!When the intellect ends, simultaneously the state of absoluteenlightenment arises with all its glory.The chit is the inner component of the non-self and has theattributes of knowledge and vision. It is the one that wandersaround without a ticket! While sitting here, the chit shows youan actual photo of any place that you have seen before. Pureknowledge + pure vision = to pure chit and that is the pure Soul;that is the Shuddhatma. Impure knowledge + impure vision =impure chit. The world is immersed in the infinite chit.

This meansthat one does not even remember what one has renounced; thatis called natural renunciation. The one who gives up smokingcigarettes naturally, does not even remember it and the one whogives it up through the exercise of the ego will keep remembering,‘I gave up smoking’!The one who despite being immersed in the ocean ofacquisitiveness (parigraha), is not touched by even a singledrop of it, is the true aparigrahi (one with non-acquisitiveness)!How can one, who is drowning even in a puddle of acquisitiveness,be called an aparigrahi?

Only the Gnani Purush; the One who Himself hasbecome ‘that’ form (Yogeshwar - the one who has attained thefinal union; the ultimate Self), can properly know YogeshwarKrishna and can explain exactly what He meant to say. This isbecause one Gnani can never be different from another Gnani;they are one from the real perspective.At the end of all the four Vedas (Hindu scriptures), whatdo the Vedas themselves say?

Devotion isneeded until one meets a Gnani; once he meets a Gnani Purush,he has to request final liberation from Him. Devotion to theVitarag gives final liberation.“What is the meaning of ‘God’?” Dadashri gives us thefollowing explanation:“Is God (Bhagwan) a name (noun) or an adjective? If itis a noun, we have to call Him ‘Bhagwan-das’. God is really anadjective. Just as the word ‘bhagyavan’ (fortunate one) wasderived from the word ‘bhagya’ (fortune), the word ‘Bhagwan’(God) is derived from the word ‘Bhagwat’ (Godly, godlike).Whosoever attains God like qualities, has the adjective ‘God’attached.”- DadashriWhich is the highest bhakti?‘To remain in the awakened awareness of the absoluteenlightened knowledge as the Self, is the highest bhakti.’- Dadashri“Gnanis’ ‘pratishthit atma’ (final remaining dischargingego) remains in bhakti, and Gnan remains in Gnan (the Selfremains the Self).

This isexperienced right here in this life. First there is the experience ofthis initial moksha, and then comes the final moksha of theSiddha; the one who does not have to take another birth.Moksha can never be attained by putting the body throughsuffering. The Self by its very nature is in a state of moksha; butbecause of one’s ignorance of the Self, one experiencesbondage. When is the feeling of liberation experienced? It iswhen the Gnani Purush, with His infinite energies and spiritualpowers, shakes and awakens the worldly soul. Gnani Purush isthe manifest formless-form and represents moksha in the livingform. Within one hour, He makes one experience the Self. Thisis the phenomenal spiritual prowess of Akram Vignan!Many people are stuck in the belief that, in this day andage, the path to moksha is closed.

An analogy of thisis, although in these times, a check for Rs. 100,000 (finalmoksha) cannot be obtained, Dadashri gives us a check for Rs.99,999.99 and many have obtained it! How much loss is there?There is a loss of only one paisa!The ‘path to moksha’ is open. One only needs to find it.‘The one who wants to be free cannot be bound byanyone and the one who wants to be bound can not be freedby anyone.’- DadashriWhat is one bound by? One is bound by ignorance andone becomes liberated through knowledge; Gnan. The rootcause of all bondage is ignorance.Dadashri has opened the exact path to moksha. Wherethere is a living Gnani Purush, there is no need for scriptures orrituals. Merely complying with the Gnani’s Agnas is religion; hisAgnas verily is penance. Lord Mahavir has said, ‘Agna isreligion, Agna is penance’.The Lord also said that after 2500 years, the effect ofBhasmak Graha (planetary influence) will end and the Vitaragreligion will, once again come in to magnificence. Now the 2500years are over. With the manifestation of the Gnani Purush, whatharm can come to the Vitarag religion? Moksha will come faceto face when one becomes completely impartial; impartial eventowards one’s own (relative) self!(cid:137) There are two types of ramanata (absorption; innerattention; absorption of the self); one is in the non-self (pudgalramanata) and the other is that of the Self (atma ramanata).The one who has not even the slightest absorption in the non-self will definitely attain the bliss of the Self. One cannot attainthe Self as long as there is even the slightest of involvement withthe non-self. From the moment one is born, he remains only inpudgal ramanata. Reading the scriptures, turning the rosary,doing repentance or giving religious discourses; all are activitiesof the non-self. Only when one becomes absorbed with the Self(swa-ramanata), can moksha be attained! The one whoseswa-ramanata has commenced, is indeed unattached and non-acquisitive even though he is immersed in an ocean ofattachment and acquisitiveness. And the one who has notattained swa-ramanata is completely attached to all materialthings, despite having renounced the worldly life and attachmentto all worldly and material things. This is because he is in pudgalramanata.‘Once the detailed study and experience of the prakruti iscompleted, one becomes a Vitarag.’- Dadashri‘We’ offer my highest obeisances to the eternalsadguru Dadashri(cid:153)(cid:153)(cid:153)(cid:153)(cid:153)3940‘gates’ of moksha and this has been proven.

One only needs to find it.‘The one who wants to be free cannot be bound byanyone and the one who wants to be bound can not be freedby anyone.’- DadashriWhat is one bound by? One is bound by ignorance andone becomes liberated through knowledge; Gnan. The rootcause of all bondage is ignorance.Dadashri has opened the exact path to moksha. Wherethere is a living Gnani Purush, there is no need for scriptures orrituals. Merely complying with the Gnani’s Agnas is religion; hisAgnas verily is penance. Lord Mahavir has said, ‘Agna isreligion, Agna is penance’.The Lord also said that after 2500 years, the effect ofBhasmak Graha (planetary influence) will end and the Vitaragreligion will, once again come in to magnificence. Now the 2500years are over. With the manifestation of the Gnani Purush, whatharm can come to the Vitarag religion? Moksha will come faceto face when one becomes completely impartial; impartial eventowards one’s own (relative) self!(cid:137) There are two types of ramanata (absorption; innerattention; absorption of the self); one is in the non-self (pudgalramanata) and the other is that of the Self (atma ramanata).The one who has not even the slightest absorption in the non-self will definitely attain the bliss of the Self. One cannot attainthe Self as long as there is even the slightest of involvement withthe non-self. From the moment one is born, he remains only inpudgal ramanata. Reading the scriptures, turning the rosary,doing repentance or giving religious discourses; all are activitiesof the non-self. Only when one becomes absorbed with the Self(swa-ramanata), can moksha be attained! The one whoseswa-ramanata has commenced, is indeed unattached and non-acquisitive even though he is immersed in an ocean ofattachment and acquisitiveness. And the one who has notattained swa-ramanata is completely attached to all materialthings, despite having renounced the worldly life and attachmentto all worldly and material things. This is because he is in pudgalramanata.‘Once the detailed study and experience of the prakruti iscompleted, one becomes a Vitarag.’- Dadashri‘We’ offer my highest obeisances to the eternalsadguru Dadashri(cid:153)(cid:153)(cid:153)(cid:153)(cid:153)3940When self becomes the Self, prakruti becomes natural81The home is a garden of prakrutis82Even prakruti in the form of God87Prakruti rendered natural through Gnan89Prakruti is reactive by nature90Prakruti will comply through reasoning91(cid:132)Powerful Goddesses of natural prakruti98Mataji : Ambama99Goddess Saraswati99Goddess Lakshmiji (Goddess of wealth)103Nature of money in the current time cycle104Money after 1942106The nature of money107Outflow of money108Inflow of Money110Gnani is acquisitive and non-acquisitive115(cid:132)The Law of ‘no laws’119Discretion in matters of law123(cid:132)Dharmadhyan125Dhyan itself is purusharth125Artadhyan – Raudradhyan127Four pillars of dharmadhyan130Worrying is artadhyan133To bite the nimit135Pratikraman ends karma137Four types of meditations141Hard raudradhyan145Cause of the worldly life146What is raudradhyan?146What is artadhyan?147What is dharmadhyan152Bhagwan is the one without clash153(cid:132)Nijdosh : Faults of the self158ContentsPage(cid:132)The reality of this world1How alert are you of your own digestive processes?2Who is the creator of this world?3Only solution to solve the worldly puzzle4Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh4Not Yamraj (God of Death) but Niyamraj (NaturalLaw)5(cid:132)Foundation on which the world functions6(cid:132)Nature of religion (Dharma)9(cid:132)Real Dharma : Relative Dharma11How can you do purusharth (true inner endeavor)without becoming a purush (the Self)?15That which increases the keyf (intoxicate the ego) isrelative knowledge15How can there be liberation for the one who takessides?18(cid:132)Nature of worldly life: nature of vairagya (dispassion)22Only the pure Soul is your true relative26Attachment and its consequences31Minding one’s own affairs33Do Celestial beings have to suffer too?35Bliss of an oasis in the middle of the desert35(cid:132)Evolution as exposed by Lord Mahavir38Who bears the weight, you or the horse?40(cid:132)Tree of the worldly life42(cid:132)True God : True Guru: True Religion44(cid:132)Religion of idols : Religion of the formless47Jinamudra -

These names represent the three naturalattributes (gunas). In the process of learning about the threegunas, people misused the information and hence created thesethree idols. What was meant to be said was that we need to getrid of these three gunas of the prakruti (characteristics traits ofthe complex of the non-self) in order to become pure.Questioner : By getting rid of these three gunas?Dadashri : Yes. Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh aresymbolic representations of the three gunas and you have totranscend them. Bliss exists within you but why can you not findit? You cannot experience it because of obstacles. Who createdthese obstacles? Did God create them? No, you yourselfcreated the obstacles. And these obstacles are such that evenwhen happiness comes to you, they will not let you experienceit. Otherwise, you are the supreme Lord, but alas you havecreated the obstacles, no one else.

That means it takes holdwithin and decreases the kashaya (anger, pride, deceit andgreed) within.The nature of anger, pride, deceit and greed (kashayabhaav) is such that they will not decrease. Rather, they keepincreasing within. They will not decrease by one’s own efforts.They will decrease through religion (dharma) as defined above.Where will one attain such a religion? From a Gnani Purush. Itshould be a religion certified by the Gnani. Thereafter, use of justtwo words of the Gnani Purush, words that are laden with theenergy that brings exact results (vachanbad), words thatawaken and maintain awakened awareness (jagruti), willshatter the veils of ignorance to release tremendous energiesfrom within.That which brings forth results is religion (dharma). Thatwhich does not bring forth a result is not religion (adharma).What is the result? Religion decreases one’s kashays.They become lighter, lesser and ultimately they leave.

If not, the spinning toy (term Dadashri uses for theplight of the human being who enters one life after the other bycreating karmas through ignorance, the analogy being thespinning top which stops spinning at death) remains the sameuntil the time of death (nanami). How can one call that religion?What does it mean ‘to become the religion and then bringforth result’? What result is to be expected? Is it to learn howto take a vow, discipline, penance? No, none of these. It meansto be rid of anger, pride, illusionary attachment, deceit and greed(kashays). To be rid of these kashays is called dharma(religion). Then some say, what about these daily introspectiveperiods (samayiks), meditation sessions (dhyan), listening todiscourses (pravachans)? Is that not religion? The Lord says,no that is not religion. The Lord advises you to ask theseteachers of religion if they experience kashays with theirdisciples. The master will then reply that none of the disciplesfollow their instructions to do samayik and therefore they getvery upset from within. Now, is that dharma? Are they followingreligion? No, on the contrary they are only increasing thekashays.Religion does not exist in samayiks (introspection) etc.Religion exists in the expression of meaningful results.

Chantingmantras (japa) is the dharma of speech. Meditation is dharmaof the mind. Bathing, performing religious rituals are the dharmaof the body.Everything remains within the parameter of its owndharma. The mind remains in the dharma of the mind, theintellect remains within its own dharma, the chit remains in thedharma of the chit, the ego remains in the dharma of the ego, theears remain in the dharma of the ears. Ears do the work oflistening; they are not involved in the action of seeing. The eyesperform the action of seeing and not listening. The nose isinvolved in the action of smelling, the tongue plays its role bytasting and the tactile sense is involved in the feeling of touch.Every sense is always involved in the function of its own subjectmatter (dharma).When the mind is involved in its dharma, the mind mayhave good thoughts or bad thoughts but nonetheless, it is in itsown dharma. When thoughts are good, one says, “My thoughtsare good,” because of the illusion (bhranti). Here one becomesone with the thoughts (tanmayakar). When thoughts arenegative, he remains separate from the thoughts saying, “I havethese terrible thoughts even when I do not want to.” Thefunction (dharma) of each component of the antah-karan (theinternal functioning mechanism in every human being composedof the mind, the intellect, chit and ego) is separate. The functionof the mind is separate, function of the chit is separate, functionof the intellect is separate and function of the ego is separate.But one interferes in their functioning and creates a mess! Tobecome one with thoughts is the illusion. When interference ofbecoming the owner of the thought ceases? It is when the GnaniPurush bestows the knowledge of the Soul; the knowledge ofone’s real Self, one ceases to become one with everything thattakes place within and without. As the Self, one becomesimpartial. Then there will be no support for the mind, the chit,the intellect, the ego or the body. You become one with thembecause of the false projection (aropit bhaav) ‘I am the body’.Once you attain the Self, you remain separate as the knowerand the seer.Everyone in the world is practicing relative dharma. Theyare engaged in the dharma of the body, the speech and the mind.They believe the dharma of the mind to be their own dharma.True dharma is where one believes the Self to be the onlydharma. All others are relative dharmas. Dharma of the Self isthe only real dharma; that is the dharma of the Self (swadharma)and that is liberation (moksha). One needs to know dharma ofthe Self.

And that is why ‘We’ are telling you to get yourwork done. This body is like a bubble, there is no telling whenit may burst. Sitting within is Dada Bhagwan, he is the supremeLord; his presence is magnificent and powerful. Therefore,people will achieve salvation as long as this ‘bubble’ exists. Thisis because the supreme Lord within is very pleased with me; theLord of the three worlds (lokas) follows my wishes. The Lorddoes not have speech, neither does he have hands or feet andthat is why he has surrendered to me and has made me aninstrument (nimit) in this path of salvation of this world. And thatis why ‘We’ are saying, “Get your work done as long as thisbubble remains intact.”Here, with me, the only dharma is the dharma of the Self.Here, there is only the path that is free of all contradictions.Elsewhere in the world, there is practice of relative religions. Tomake a false projection of being what you are not, to live as ‘Iam Chandulal,’ to walk the path where good deeds areadvocated and bad ones are denounced; to maintain an obligingnature towards everyone, even when it is done in the entire life,all that ultimately remains in the domain of the relative dharma.And here, if you practice the real dharma, if you realize the Selfeven for just a second; then there is liberation. The Lord hassaid that if you were to say, ‘I am the Self’, even just once afterbecoming the Soul, then you will get your work done.Otherwise, even if you keep repeating, ‘I am the Soul and thebody and all its entanglements are not mine’, for a million lifetimes, you will not gain anything. What does the Lord say? Hesays, ‘You believe you are Chandulal.’ This has also becomeyour faith. Your faith is not broken. That belief or knowledge isnot broken and neither is your conduct any different and if yousay, ‘I am the Soul’, then you will never achieve liberation. Howcan you say you are the Soul when all the while you remain inthe false belief of ‘I am Chandulal’? How can you say you arethe Soul when you speak as if you are Chandulal? When thefalse projection of your knowledge and vision of beingChandulal are broken and you are placed in the right belief andknowledge (of being the pure Soul), only then is liberationpossible.What do the relative dharmas preach? They tell you tostop doing bad deeds and do good ones. Good deeds bindmerit (punya) karma and bad deeds bind demerit (paap) karma.It is not possible to do only good deeds your entire life. If youcall someone names, you create five rupees worth of demeritkarma and if you do philanthropic work, you earn hundredrupees worth of merit karma. Your demerit karma cannot besubtracted from the merit karma. If that were possible,millionaires would not allow any demerit karmas to accumulate.They would spend their money to pay off their debts of demeritkarma. But this is real justice. And therefore one has to sufferthe consequences of whatever karma is unfolding. Merit karmawill bring you happiness as it unfolds and when your demeritkarma unfolds, you will find its fruits very bitter. You have nochoice, but to taste the fruits of both kinds of karma. Lord saysto plant the seed of the fruit you can afford to taste. If you wanthappiness, then plant seeds of merit karma and if you wantunhappiness, then plant seeds of demerit karma; but both meritand demerit karma are relative dharma, they are not real. In realdharma, dharma of the Self, liberation from both merit anddemerit karma is attained. Relative dharma will bring youmaterial happiness and will help you towards the path ofliberation, whereas real dharma will grant you liberation. Here,with me, you will attain the real dharma which will give youliberation directly. Only here you will experience the bliss ofliberation. You will experience freedom from physical ailments(adhi), mental anguish (vyadhi) and miseries imposed upon youby others (upadhi) and constantly experience the bliss of theSelf (samadhi). Only here does the state of absolute easiness(nirakudata) exist. There are talks of the Self (atma) and theAptavani-21314Aptavani-2just one hour! And that is why ‘We’ are telling you to get yourwork done. This body is like a bubble, there is no telling whenit may burst. Sitting within is Dada Bhagwan, he is the supremeLord; his presence is magnificent and powerful. Therefore,people will achieve salvation as long as this ‘bubble’ exists. Thisis because the supreme Lord within is very pleased with me; theLord of the three worlds (lokas) follows my wishes. The Lorddoes not have speech, neither does he have hands or feet andthat is why he has surrendered to me and has made me aninstrument (nimit) in this path of salvation of this world. And thatis why ‘We’ are saying, “Get your work done as long as thisbubble remains intact.”Here, with me, the only dharma is the dharma of the Self.Here, there is only the path that is free of all contradictions.Elsewhere in the world, there is practice of relative religions.

He harboredthe notion ‘I know something’ and ‘I am doing some purusharth.’‘We’ asked him, “What do you do? What is your purusharth?”and he replied, “All my efforts are solely for the soul.” ‘We’asked him, “How can you do purusharth without becoming apurush? You dance according to the tunes of your relative self(prakruti) and you say, ‘I danced’.”‘We’ challenge anyone in this entire world that whateverhe is doing, it is not under his own independent power. Arey!Even when you go to the toilet to evacuate your bowels, it is notyour own independent doing. Some 250 very prominent doctorscame to satsang in Baroda and ‘We’ asked them, “You claim totreat your patients who are constipated, but do you think it isunder your control to evacuate their bowels?” They all claimed,“But indeed we are the ones who help them go to the toilet.”‘We’ asked them, “When you do not have independent controlover your own bowel movements, how can you have controlover someone else’s?

Thedifference between prakrutgnan and atmagnan (knowledge ofthe Self, real knowledge) is like the difference between milk andbuttermilk. How does relative knowledge work? It uses prakrutito wash away prakruti; doing this makes the prakruti light. Aperson can spend his entire life time washing away his prakruti(the non-self complex) but if in his next life he falls into badcompany, his prakruti can become very dense again. The Lordhas equated this to an elephant bathing in a muddy pool. Whenan elephant bathes in water, he becomes nice and clean but themoment he comes out of the water, he dusts his body with mud.Such is the state of the human being. Atmagnan is rare,extremely, extremely rare. Liberation is merely a word and anyreference to it is mere talk because it is not so easy to attain.Everyone with prakrutgnan believes, ‘I know everything’. Thepitiful ones! All they know is prakrutgnan; it is all relativeknowledge. What they need to know is atmagnan (knowledgeof the Soul). For so many lifetimes all you have attained isprakrutgnan and what do you claim? All along the prakruti hasbeen the doer and yet you claim, ‘I did it’. Prakruti makes youdance, it makes you wake up in the morning, but you claim, ‘Iwoke up’.

If these preceptors were to admit, ‘Wedon’t know anything about atmagnan’, they can come closer totheir liberation.Is having the knowledge of prakrutgnan of any use? No,because atmagnan is needed for liberation. Atmagnan is notfound in books or scriptures; it exists with the Gnani. It is thetask for the one who has nothing left to know in this world, noscriptures to read and no rosary to turn. If we see someonereading scriptures or turning the rosary, can we not deduce thathe is still in the process of learning? Can we not deduce that heis in a certain standard? How can he teach us when he himselfstill has to study? Only the one who has become absolute canbe of help to us. All the religions in the world are relative andof varying standards. Everyone finds an appropriate standarddepending upon his or her spiritual development. However forthe real religion, religion of the Self, you will have to go ‘out ofstandard’. Only after having passed and accepting all thestandards, does one become the supreme Self!How can there be liberation for the one whotakes sides?Jainism, Vaishnavism, Shaivism, Swaminarayans, Islam,Christianity are all relative religions; they are religions of‘standards’. They are religions of different viewpoints. Whateverone sees according to his viewpoint, he accepts it as beingcorrect and gets entrenched in it. When is liberation attained? Itis when absolute vision is attained? When is real knowledgeattained? This happens when there is no conflict of opinion withanyone in this entire world and when there is no partialitytowards any being. The one who is partial can never attainmoksha. Why does one become partial? People with ego createsides to support their ego, whereas the impartial Gnani uniteseveryone. The Gnanis are always impartial; the vitarag Lords(fully enlightened supreme beings who have no attachment totheir relative self or the world) are always impartial. They haveno partiality towards any race or creed; they are absolutely andperfectly impartial. They have oneness with everyone; even withthe minutest living thing.All beings are ‘packings’ (packages) of one kind oranother. There are all varieties of packing but within themresides the Self. The ‘material’ within, i.e. the soul withineveryone is exactly the same. However, divisive intellect hasarisen because of the external differences. The Gnani does notlook at the packing at all; he only sees the ‘material’ within. Heconstantly sees the soul in the person in front of him.

The Lord himself is impartial andyet people have become partial. The Jains say, “This is ours, thatis not, that belongs to the Vaishnavs.” The Muslims too say,“This is ours. This is not, this belongs to the Hindus.” Everyonein all religions take sides. Here, with the Gnani there isclarification for people of all religions.

Only here is therea coming together of all religions.When people become partial, they move further awayfrom the Lord within. Not only have people become partial butthey have also created so many different divisions within just onefaith. Even amongst Jains, there are eighty-four different sectsand there are so many factions amongst the Vedantis too. Whatis the definition of the Jain dharma? It is when one does not takesides. What is more, if someone creates divisions, a true Jainwould go to that person to explain things to him in details andtry to overcome any conflict of opinions. The definition of a trueJain is that even when he is right and the other person iscompletely wrong, he would still approach the other personhimself. Many will say to him, “Why do you bother with himwhen you are right?” But the one practicing true Jainism will say,“I am a Jain and that is why I have to approach him.” A Jainis someone who has no obstinacy about any perspective andwho listens to everyone. He will listen to everyone and will notallow any viewpoints to cloud his own vision; he remainsfocused. He would not resort to deceit, ‘Yours is wrong andmine is right’.

The soul has threeAptavani-22122Aptavani-2layers of ‘clothings’: the cloth of the mind, the cloth of speechand the cloth of the body. These are the ‘clothes’ the Lord wasreferring to. A true Digambar is the one who takes off theseclothing and completely exposes the Self. It is the clothing of themind, the speech and the body that need to be shed; theserepresent the greatest acquisitions (parigraha). These need tobe shed.Shall ‘We’ tell you what all this taking-sides is like? Is itpossible for a person to think that he is not good looking? If itwere then people would not get along with the mirror at all, butthe fact that they do, is because of their partiality. A trulybeautiful face is that which keeps coming back to the mindwithin. Whereas here; one is partial and prejudiced. The aura ofthe one who is impartial will exude to all around him. People,who are partial and prejudiced, repel others wherever they go.They ‘smell horrible’ (not respected) even in their own homes!So many people will ask me, “Are you a Jain?” or “Areyou a Vaishnav?” You foolish people! What Jain or whatVaishnav? I am a vitarag. ‘We’ are in all religions. By calling mea Jain or a Vaishnav, people create an obstacle for themselves.They think of me as being partial towards a certain religion, butif they were to see me doing darshan of Lord Ramchandraji justonce, all their beliefs would be broken. But alas, one needsmerit karma for that too!* * * * *Nature of worldly life : nature of vairagya(dispassion)Sansar (the worldly life) is nothing but a betrayal. In it, noone is related to you. If a person were to clearly understand theterrible misery of worldly life, he would have an intense desirefor liberation. This terrible misery of the world is a counterweight for liberation. One feels the intense desire for liberationas misery increases.Today, a person may find the world fearfully miserableand yet because of the illusion he continues to suffer its repeatedblunt beating. He continues to put up with the beatings saying,‘Things will improve tomorrow’, but does brass ever turn intogold? No, it will never turn to gold. That is why it is importantto understand its horrible misery for once and for all. As it is,one is under a false belief that he can derive happiness from theworld; ‘I will be happy if I do this’. Alas! Even here, one issubject to a beating.If the Gnani Purush were to merely describe the terriblemisery of this world, one will definitely begin to question, ‘Is theworld so terrible? There is no way to escape from it. We mustsolve it once and for all.’ You can become free from the worldlyentanglements through submission. ‘Yes sir. Yes, sir’ is what youhave to do in order to disentangle yourself. This world is suchthat it calls for settling all matters with equanimity.This is a very profound fact that ‘We’ are telling you.

These are the ‘clothes’ the Lord wasreferring to. A true Digambar is the one who takes off theseclothing and completely exposes the Self. It is the clothing of themind, the speech and the body that need to be shed; theserepresent the greatest acquisitions (parigraha). These need tobe shed.Shall ‘We’ tell you what all this taking-sides is like? Is itpossible for a person to think that he is not good looking? If itwere then people would not get along with the mirror at all, butthe fact that they do, is because of their partiality. A trulybeautiful face is that which keeps coming back to the mindwithin. Whereas here; one is partial and prejudiced. The aura ofthe one who is impartial will exude to all around him. People,who are partial and prejudiced, repel others wherever they go.They ‘smell horrible’ (not respected) even in their own homes!So many people will ask me, “Are you a Jain?” or “Areyou a Vaishnav?” You foolish people! What Jain or whatVaishnav? I am a vitarag. ‘We’ are in all religions. By calling mea Jain or a Vaishnav, people create an obstacle for themselves.They think of me as being partial towards a certain religion, butif they were to see me doing darshan of Lord Ramchandraji justonce, all their beliefs would be broken. But alas, one needsmerit karma for that too!* * * * *Nature of worldly life : nature of vairagya(dispassion)Sansar (the worldly life) is nothing but a betrayal. In it, noone is related to you. If a person were to clearly understand theterrible misery of worldly life, he would have an intense desirefor liberation. This terrible misery of the world is a counterweight for liberation. One feels the intense desire for liberationas misery increases.Today, a person may find the world fearfully miserableand yet because of the illusion he continues to suffer its repeatedblunt beating. He continues to put up with the beatings saying,‘Things will improve tomorrow’, but does brass ever turn intogold? No, it will never turn to gold. That is why it is importantto understand its horrible misery for once and for all. As it is,one is under a false belief that he can derive happiness from theworld; ‘I will be happy if I do this’. Alas! Even here, one issubject to a beating.If the Gnani Purush were to merely describe the terriblemisery of this world, one will definitely begin to question, ‘Is theworld so terrible? There is no way to escape from it. We mustsolve it once and for all.’ You can become free from the worldlyentanglements through submission. ‘Yes sir. Yes, sir’ is what youhave to do in order to disentangle yourself. This world is suchthat it calls for settling all matters with equanimity.This is a very profound fact that ‘We’ are telling you.

In the same way, when thesehuman beings turn to skin and bones; when there is no ‘pulp’ leftin them, even their children will kick them!An old lady and her son lived next door to us. The oldlady was blind but she worked all day long taking care of thehome. One day her son’s boss came to their home. The son wasthe boss in the home and the other man was the boss at work!Both these ‘bosses’ came home. The son thought to himself, ifmy boss sees my blind mother, I will loose my reputation and sohe tells her, “Hey you blind woman! Get up, my boss is here.”He kicks (insults) his mother to impress his boss! The fool! Asif he is some big shot! The dope! Should he be thinking ofprotecting his mother or his boss?Why do people buy mangos? They do so because of thepulp and its juice. Similarly, this whole world has selfish motives.That is why only the Lord within is real and so if we haveattained something when we attain liberation, otherwise they willtell you, “Get up you blind woman!”Some people complain, “We don’t have any children.”What are they going to do with children, put them on apedestal? Of what use are children when they mistreat theirparents? Instead, it is better not to have any; besides in whichpast life did you not have children? All these animals, dogs, cats,donkeys, cows, buffalo have carried their young around theirnecks in their past lives too, have they not? You have attainedthis human birth with great difficulty so why don’t you shape upnow at least! Look for the instruments that will help you attainliberation and get your work done. An old lady will say, “Damnthis worldly life, it is filled with misery”, when her son mistreatsher. We can ask her, “Dear lady, was this worldly life notmiserable before?” The worldly life has always been miserablebut it appears sweet because of illusion (moha) and infatuationwhiff of it and comes to eat it. She tips the pot over and eatsthe yogurt. There is still some yogurt left in the pot, so her greeddrives her to push her whole face inside the pot, and shebecomes trapped in it. There is nothing but total darkness insideand so she runs around trying to get free. Now how can sheescape such a trap? In the same way, the entire world is caughtin such a trap. How can a person escape from his own trap?The cat can only become free if someone frees her. In the sameway, only a Gnani can free you from the trap of this world, noone else can. A person can never become free on his own; onthe contrary, he will sink deeper.I had studied and analyzed this scenario about the catwhen I was young. I used to put a pot of yogurt as bait andwatch it quietly. I did not care whether the yogurt would bewasted but at least I would be able to see and learn from it. Ifone gets a direct experience of this trap, then why would he befoolish enough to fall in it again? Despite getting her head stuckin the pot once, if a cat were to see a pot of milk again, she willforget her previous predicament and do the same thing overagain. Then she will regret it but what can anyone do after thefact? Even if she has been trapped once, does she remembershe should not repeat the mistake? No, she forgets even whenshe is punished. What hope is there for animals when evenhuman beings forget? This body will never become yours.Despite this people say, “This is mine, he is mine, she is mine.”You miserable people, when your body is not your own, howcan anyone else be yours?You are coming home from Calcutta and on the way youbuy some nice mangos; you have to handle them with carebecause you do not have a basket to carry them in. What ismore you have to carry them yourself since you do not haveyour servant with you. After you bring them home, you eat themand you throw away the skin and its stone (seed). For heaven’ssake!

Whatever spiritual work you accomplish in this life will beyour own and yours to keep.If a passenger in a train, which has now entered theoutskirts of Mumbai on the way to Mumbai Central Station,opens up his bedding to go to sleep, people will say that he iscrazy because Mumbai Station is fast approaching. He is foolishbecause he is making his bed when he has to disembark. Manystart to play cards even when the train passes Borivalli (suburb)station. At least get up now, the final station is approaching.Start packing your belongings, be forewarned, whateverawareness you maintain, you will benefit from it.Aptavani-23132Aptavani-2This worldly life is filled with sheer danger, it is full ofhorror and disgust and what is more, it is constantly this way. Isit not a wonder that people have attachment for it?Attachment and its consequencesWhat will you have attachment (moha) for? Fake gold?!You can afford to have attachment if it were real but truly allworldly relationships are like the relationship between a sellerand a buyer. Customers will pay only if the goods are of goodquality. If you were to fight just one hour with your husband,your relationship will break down, how can you have attachmentfor such relationships?A wealthy businessman says he will work to make moneybecause he wants to pass his inheritance on to his sons. Heresorts to corrupt and devious means in order to make moneyand that too in foreign lands, which he will pass on to hischildren. The son has a relation with you which is temporary andhe has a big ego. If his relationship with you were real then itwould be beneficial for you to pass on your inheritance but reallythat relationship is sustained because of societal pressure. If afather and son were to get into an argument, they may even endup in a court! Many sons say they will place their father in thehomes for the elderly. Don’t they put away aging bullocks inthose special places? Similarly they want to send their fathers offto the homes for the elderly. What a nice name they have givento such establishments! ‘We’ fail to understand why one is sostuck in a relationship such as this. If such relationships weregentle and congenial, one could afford to let things be. Are youalso not aware of incidents where sons have imprisoned theirfathers in order to take over the kingdom?This world is like an oil mill; the men are like the bullocksthat turn the wheel that works the rig that crushes the seeds foroil and the women are like the masters of the bullocks. In theoil rig the bullock master ‘sings’ and here the women ‘sing’. Thebullock has blinders on his eyes and therefore he remainsengrossed in his own world, as he toils walking round andround, he thinks ‘we must have reached our destination’, butwhen the blinders are removed he realizes he is in the sameplace as before. The oil maker then feeds the bullock some oilcake and the bullock is happy, and here the wife feeds thehusband some handvo (baked spicy dish) and he sleepspeacefully.When one enters a hospital for an illness and sees thesuffering there, his moha (attachment) would leave. Alas thisdoes not remain in his awareness. If it did he would lose hisattachment for this worldly life. When the wife gets a largepimple on her face, the husband does not like to look at her.Both wonder what others will think if they see her. Aren’tpeople like mangos? They don’t like mangos when their skinbecomes wrinkled. ‘We’ view human beings as mangos becausethey become rotten and decay like mangos do. It would be adifferent matter if the mangos were never to wrinkle and rot, butthe moment you bring them home, they begin to wrinkle.

There is more pain than pleasure in the juice of life.What bliss can there be in such a fruit? All day long you haveto drink the bitter juice and once in a while, it gives you a littlesweetness. Why not drink all the bitterness instead? How canone afford to be fooled in this way? We could accept it if therewere fifty percent bitterness and fifty percent sweetness. Wecould even accept fifty-five percent bitterness but having saidthis, the bitterness just seems to increase. There is ninety-fivepercent suffering and only five percent pleasure in this worldlylife. For a trace of this pleasure, how can you afford to put upwith a life like this? There is an ocean of bliss within you whichyou would experience, provided you are not distracted by adrop of pleasure of the worldly life. Your memory of worldlypleasures prevents you from experiencing the bliss within you.This time cycle is very strange indeed. It is so strange thatone can say even the bitter melons taste sweet. In the currenttimes all you should do, is do darshan (acknowledge withreverence) of the Lord within everyone, but keep your distancefrom the packing (body complex). No matter how rotten theexternal packing is, do darshan of the Lord within and keepyour distance. People may say, he was like an angel, but he toowent on the funeral pyre, albeit one of sandalwood.

In this age of Kaliyug the head smells,the body smells and that is why they put flowers in their hair tocover the body odor.

Hewas talking to his wife and ‘We’ heard their conversation.“What vegetables did you buy?” he asked his wife.“Okra”, she replied.“How much were they?” he asked.“Twelve anaa for a kilo”, she replied.“How can you pay so much for vegetables? Don’t youhave any sense?” he rebuked her.‘We’ happened to overhear this and so ‘We’ asked him,“Why do you go around carrying this ‘two ton weight’ on yourhead? Your face looks like you just drank some castor oil!”Why? If she paid twelve anaas (Indian currency) for a kilo ofokra, that is a burden on the worldly life and you have to putthat weight on the ‘horse of the worldly burden’. Even if youcarry that burden on your head, it really remains on the worldly‘horse’. We should not be taking this weight on our heads. Infact, it is because we put this weight on our head that our faceslook as if we drank castor oil and so does the horse’s (worldlylife)!ascetic in his subsequent life. In this manner, he has spentcountless lifetimes just wandering back and forth. However, hewould attain liberation if he were to attain the knowledge of theSelf. For this he needs to find a Gnani Purush, who will burn allhis sins in the fire of knowledge and bestow upon him the stateof the Self. Only then can he say, “I am pure Soul.” He cannotsay this without attaining the Self from the Gnani Purush. Withoutthe realization of the Self in this manner, merely saying the wordswould be of no use and may even harm him. That would bemere knowledge of words.This life is a balance sheet of one’s countless past lives.Nevertheless, his experiences have not been in vain, hisexperiences do come in use. Once a person falls in a ditch, hewill be very alert if he comes across another one. Experiencesare actually teachers.Here you have to get your work done and then go tomoksha (attain final liberation). This body will never becomeyours so how can anyone else become yours? If this bodybecomes helpful in the work of the Gnani, then it is your friendbut if it takes you towards the worldly life, it is a foe and abetrayal. Everyone is related to the body, no one is related tothe Self. The Self never has any relations. Therefore, this pointis worth understanding. The vitarag Lords understood everythingabout the world; they knew everything about it and hadconcluded, “I have nothing to do with this world. It does notappeal to me. It is a betrayal.” We too have to understand thisfact completely and get our work done.This universe has arisen from six eternal elements; theworldly life is a manifestation of the interaction of these sixelements. The phases of these elements are constantly changing.The coming together of these six elements gives rise to theuniversal life. These elements are eternal (sat).

Matter (jada)and the Self (chetan) are together as a mixture, not as acompound.Who bears the weight, you or the horse?‘We’ once paid a surprise visit to a friend of ‘ours’. Hewas talking to his wife and ‘We’ heard their conversation.“What vegetables did you buy?” he asked his wife.“Okra”, she replied.“How much were they?” he asked.“Twelve anaa for a kilo”, she replied.“How can you pay so much for vegetables? Don’t youhave any sense?” he rebuked her.‘We’ happened to overhear this and so ‘We’ asked him,“Why do you go around carrying this ‘two ton weight’ on yourhead? Your face looks like you just drank some castor oil!”Why? If she paid twelve anaas (Indian currency) for a kilo ofokra, that is a burden on the worldly life and you have to putthat weight on the ‘horse of the worldly burden’. Even if youcarry that burden on your head, it really remains on the worldly‘horse’. We should not be taking this weight on our heads. Infact, it is because we put this weight on our head that our faceslook as if we drank castor oil and so does the horse’s (worldlylife)!ascetic in his subsequent life. In this manner, he has spentcountless lifetimes just wandering back and forth. However, hewould attain liberation if he were to attain the knowledge of theSelf. For this he needs to find a Gnani Purush, who will burn allhis sins in the fire of knowledge and bestow upon him the stateof the Self. Only then can he say, “I am pure Soul.” He cannotsay this without attaining the Self from the Gnani Purush. Withoutthe realization of the Self in this manner, merely saying the wordswould be of no use and may even harm him. That would bemere knowledge of words.This life is a balance sheet of one’s countless past lives.Nevertheless, his experiences have not been in vain, hisexperiences do come in use. Once a person falls in a ditch, hewill be very alert if he comes across another one. Experiencesare actually teachers.Here you have to get your work done and then go tomoksha (attain final liberation). This body will never becomeyours so how can anyone else become yours? If this bodybecomes helpful in the work of the Gnani, then it is your friendbut if it takes you towards the worldly life, it is a foe and abetrayal. Everyone is related to the body, no one is related tothe Self. The Self never has any relations. Therefore, this pointis worth understanding. The vitarag Lords understood everythingabout the world; they knew everything about it and hadconcluded, “I have nothing to do with this world. It does notappeal to me. It is a betrayal.” We too have to understand thisfact completely and get our work done.This universe has arisen from six eternal elements; theworldly life is a manifestation of the interaction of these sixelements. The phases of these elements are constantly changing.The coming together of these six elements gives rise to theuniversal life. These elements are eternal (sat). An eternalelement is with its inherent properties and phases. The visibleAptavani-24142Aptavani-2One man was riding his pony. He was a heavyset man andthe pony was small and frail. The pony seemed to buckle underhis weight. As they were trudging along, he came across anotherman who asked him if he wanted some green grass for his pony.This fellow was tempted to take the grass since it was free butat the same time he was concerned about the added weight onthe pony. He thought a little bit and not being too bright, decidedthat if he put the bale of grass on his own head, the pony wouldnot have to carry the extra weight. So he put the bale of grasson his head and sat on the pony and took off. On the way hecomes across a Vanik gentleman who tells him, “Brother, youare carrying the bale on your head, but the load still falls on thepony and that is why both you and the pony look as if you dranksome castor oil!”This worldly life is like the pony. Thinking the pony to bea weakling, that man sits on it worrying about the weight thepony has to bear but his assessment is incorrect. Ultimately theload falls on the pony alone. Similarly, all of you should put theload of your worldly life on the worldly pony where it belongs.Do not sit on the pony of the worldly life with any worries. Donot have worries as you live your life. The Self, the knower ofthe universe has entered the worldly life and lost his knower-ship; his original abode. Everyone in the world is fooled in thisway.

But instead, people have now completely done awaywith idols and new paths of devotion to only the guru have beenestablished.How can one make disparaging remarks like, “Here goesthe procession of the inanimate idols?” Are such commentsappropriate? How can ridiculing the idols for which people havetremendous reverence be appropriate? Nevertheless, the idolswill have to be put aside in order to gain awareness of theimportance of a guru. However idols are correct for those whohave not yet been able to have a positive focus on anything inlife. Where else can those who have not known the formless, notseen the formless, and not heard the formless; and not evenaware of the existence of the formless, go? Where will they go,Maharaj?Maharaj you are calling this idol inanimate, so show methe animate (chetan) that you have seen. Have you seen thechetan that you are calling the idol inanimate? You yourself areinanimate; a mechanical soul!The maharaj replied, “But the Guru is chetan, is he not?”‘We’ said, “No. Everything that is seen, heard andexperienced through the five senses is nothing but inanimate. TheNavkar Mantra you recite has a form too. People havetremendous faith and feelings for the idol of the vitarag Lords,so do not look upon it with abhorrence.”“But our principle does not believe in idols!” said themaharaj.‘We’ said, “Maharaj, think a little. If what ‘We’ are tellingyou is wrong, then ‘We’ will accept it as such. If you feeloffended or hurt, then ‘We’ will do your pratikraman(apology), but at least think a little! Let the people of the primarystandard be and you do what suits you. One is a trueSthanakvasi only when he has established the visual form of theLord in between the eyebrows (the location of the subtle mind);when a mental image has been established.”The Maharaj said, “I am not able to accept what you aresaying.”‘We’ said, “Maharaj, how can you believe what ‘We’ aresaying? ‘We’ are even willing to accept that you find what ‘We’are saying is wrong, because a person believes whatever hedoes as being the right thing. A butcher cannot see any sin inwhat he does, because whatever actions a doer does, theyinvariably create a veil (avaran) over the act itself, in the doer.Aptavani-25152Aptavani-2Hence the doer loses the ability to discriminate whether theaction is right or wrong. So what can anyone do? When aperson loses discrimination between right and wrong, thatperson will not understand the truth even in a hundred thousandlifetimes, no matter what he does.”‘We’ were pleading with a tapogachha (one whobelieves in penance of physical means in order to attain theultimate reality) maharaj, “If you feel offended, you can slanderme all you like, but let me ask you one thing, are you doingpenance for liberation?”The Maharaj said, “Of course. What else would I bedoing penance for?”‘We’ said, “The Lord has said, “Penance for liberationshould not be a visible. No one should be able to see yourpenance. Your penance is like the heavy workouts in agymnasium. Are you doing workouts? How can you call thispenance? This is not the type of penance required for liberation.The Lord has said ‘no’ to such penance.” The Lord has saidthat unless the body becomes natural and spontaneous, neitherwill the soul. When the body becomes natural and spontaneous,so will the soul, or when the soul becomes natural andspontaneous, so will the body. When either one becomes naturaland spontaneous, so will the other and that is when your workwill be accomplished.Why have idols been set aside? It is because apathy canset in, in idol worship. The idol is not going to get angry withyou, is it? The idol is not going to question why you did not dosamayik (introspection on errors committed), will it? At leastthe Guru will tell you off! But calling an idol inanimate completelychanges the meaning for its existence. Idols are necessary andso are the temples. Until one attains the darshan of the formless(the Self), one cannot let go of the rope that keeps one afloat.Idol worship is a spiritual science of India. Only if there is an idolwill there be a temple and only if there is a temple will there bedevotees.The Lord has said that as long as there is artadhyan(adverse meditation occurring within one’s relative self) andraudradhyan (adverse meditation directed against other livingbeings), you should do darshan of an idol (murta) because untilthen you will not be able to ‘see’ the formless (amurta) one. Youwill not be able to see the Shuddhatma, the formless Lordwithin.Questioner : An idol is a piece of stone, how can onebenefit from doing its darshan?Dadashri : It is helpful to many other people, is it not?The Lord has said that one should not have a narrow-mindedperspective (ekantik) but a perspective of universal acceptance(anekantik). Anekantik means if a child is running aroundnaked, no one will tell him off, but if a fifty-year old man doesthe same, people will get angry with him. The old man mayquestion, “Why are you telling me off? Why are you not sayinganything to this child?” We would tell him, “You sir! You are anadult. This child is small and at his age what he is doing isacceptable, whereas at your age, it is not.” In this way it isnecessary to look at everyone with a universal perspective.Kabir Sahib used to live in a Muslim locality near amasjid. When it came time for the bangh (Muslim prayer ritualsof reciting the prayers as loudly as possible at predawnhours)…have you heard them sing the bangh? They put theirfingers in their ears and then they call out the bangh, do theynot? Now Kabir Sahib was very knowledgeable and aprominent saint, so he proclaimed, “Do you think Allah is deafthat you are calling out your prayers at the top of your voice?He hears everything. If you were to put ankle bells on an ant,he can hear them. So why are you shouting at the top of yourlungs? It really hurts my ears!” The Muslims became very angryAptavani-25152Aptavani-2Hence the doer loses the ability to discriminate whether theaction is right or wrong. So what can anyone do?

You made a mistake.You have to understand the other person’s viewpoint before youspeak. To speak before considering the viewpoint of others andto assess them through your own viewpoint is a very dangerousmistake. To assume that others have the same view point asyours is a big mistake.” ‘We’ would further explain to KabirSahib, “The louder they speak, the more their internal veils willshatter and Allah will hear them. Their veils are much denserthan yours. Yours are like a thin cloth so even if you were tothink in your mind, it will reach the Lord within you. For them,the louder they sing the better. For them that is correct.” Nowif the Christians were to say their prayers out loud like that, itwould ruin everything. They need a peaceful and quietsurrounding. No one must utter a word. There is a difference ineveryone’s language and beliefs. So if someone is speaking hisown ‘language’ and we speak to them in our ‘language’, it iscomparable to the incident of Kabir Sahib. Those who do notunderstand the principle of anekant will be beaten up like KabirSahib. They take a beating because of their own mistake!Kabir had tremendous awareness. Many devotees haveawareness but Kabir’s awareness was very keen. There haveonly been five to seven devotees with such awareness,tremendous awareness. Kabir did not become enlightenedalthough for him the final path to liberation was just around thecorner. Had he found the path, he would have worked wonders!During the time of Kabir, the Brahmin priests used toperform yagnas (rituals of sacrificial fire). In one such yagna,the Brahmins had brought a big goat to sacrifice in the fire. Uponseeing this Kabir inquired, “Why have you brought this goathere?” The Brahmins told Kabir, “What are you doing here? Goaway from here. This is none of your business.” Kabirunderstood immediately and spoke, “This goat is alive. He ishealthy. Why are you sacrificing him in the fire? How much painhe will feel and suffer if you throw him in the fire.” The Brahminssaid, “If we sacrifice him in the fire, he will go to heaven.” Kabirimmediately responded, “Why are you making this goat go toheaven? Why not sacrifice your father in the fire, he is growingold, why not secure a life in heaven for him instead?” What asentence to utter! It is enough to make anyone’s head spin, is itnot? So the Brahmins beat him up badly. Kabir used to getbeaten wherever he went. To speak a word without understandingthe Lord’s principle of anekant (to accept all viewpoints andremain in the center. Ekant means to have just one viewpoint),will beget you a beating! Otherwise, there has never been adevotee such as Kabir. He was wonderful; he had no worldlydesire. No worldly passion could tempt him; he had becomedesire less (nispruhi). However, he had taken a lot of beatingwherever he went because he did not understand the Lord’sanekant.It is correct for the Christian to stand quietly in a church.It is also correct for the Muslim to sing aloud their bangh prayer.If a Hindu is reciting his prayers quietly in the mind, that too iscorrect. He may say his prayers out aloud too. If he does notsay his prayer at all, if he is a little thick, tell him to speak aloud.Or if he is like the Jain who hardly vocalizes, one can tell him,“Why are you reciting the Navkar mantra in your mind, say itout loud so it can be heard.” Say it loud enough to ring the bellswithin. There is different medicine for everyone. Every humanbeing has a different disease and therefore there are differentmedicines. What would happen if you to tell me to giveeveryone the medicine to throw up? So this is what the worldis like; that is why the Lord has given anekant.

The bellsare used to help focus the worshiper’s chit; they also help drownout other noises. The incense and the aromatic dhoop are alsoutilized to help people focus.Jinamudra - The posture of the OmniscientThe vitarag Lords state, “We do not accept anything yougive us and whatever you offer is returned to you with thanks.If you offer twenty-five cents, you will get many more in return.If you offer a flower, you will get many more flowers in returnand if you insult us, you will receive many more insults in return.”Just once surrender your all through your mind, speech andbody to the vitarag Lord and see for yourself the abundantresults. The idol of the vitarag Lord is very unique. Have youseen such a posture (mudra) in an idol of any others? No otheridol posture is comparable. Whatever the level of one’s spiritualdevelopment, such will be one’s idol.What is the message of the posture of the idol of thevitarag Lord? It is saying, “If you want liberation then at least inthis life, sit like me with ceased internal machinery and foldedarms and legs. Even with this posture in life, all your functionsof life will continue well.”What is there to see in an idol? Is it the stone? Is it theeyes? The idols are meant to instill internal devotional feelings(bhaav) in the worshipper: ‘This is the idol of Lord Mahavir!How wonderful was Lord Mahavir! What vitaragata (absolutedispassion) he had.’ Nowadays such internal feelings do notarise within the worshippers and so they have resorted todecorating the idols. If the idol is decorated beautifully then atleast the chit (inner component of knowledge and vision) willremain focused. In case the chit does not remain focused, theyring bells to drown out the radios and the noise that spills intothe temple from the outside. They employ different methods inorder to focus all the senses. For whatever little time theworshipers remain focused, even if it is for a fraction of asecond, they will reap that much benefit.A crowd will gather around two people who are fightingto see what is going on. Why do people do this? It is becausetheir chit does not remain focused anywhere, so it will goanywhere it finds something new to focus on. If the chit does notremain focused on the Lord’s idol, where else will it remainfocused? There is endless turmoil within everyone and so theyfind no peace anywhere. The plight of people today is like thatof a frightened horse that is startled when someone sets off afirecracker near its legs. These people need compassion. Oneneeds to have compassion for people, only compassion.Gnani instills life in an idolQuestioner : After the ritual of pranpratishtha (instillinglife in an idol), does the power of the idol increase?Dadashri : Yes it does. If one does pranpratishtha on ahooko (smoking pipe with smoke filtered through water), it toowill become powerful. However, an idol carries projectedfeelings of thousands of worshippers. It will give results when lifeis instilled in it. Nowadays however, a true pranpratishtha doesnot occur. ‘We’ (Dadashri and the fully enlightened Lord within)are able to perform true pranpratishtha but only when thecircumstance arises. ‘We’ do pratishtha for the salvation ofhumanity. The pratishtha performed by others depends upontheir spiritual level and powers. But what kind of bhaav (internalstate) is their pratishtha performed with?

If he were to attain the awareness ofwho he really is even for second, he can reach completion-liberation (purnatva). The Self is natural, the path to acquire theknowledge (of Who am I?) is straightforward and easy, but aGnani Purush is needed to give the knowledge of the Self andonly then can the Self be attained. The Gnani himself is liberatedand has the power to liberate others. He is called the savior, andthe fact that Akram Vignan has arisen in this current time cycleis a tremendous natural occurrence. This ‘lift’ path has comeabout naturally. In this path you can proceed towards liberationeven as you enjoy your worldly life, while eating bhajiya(fritters) and jalebi (sweets). Without renouncing anything orpracticing any austerities, you can experience the bliss ofliberation. In the Kramic path, one has to do penance, renounceworldly pleasures and progress one step at a time; he has topurify his ego in the process. The ego has to be purified to suchan extent that he remains unaffected even when he is shown alot of respect and importance. In the Kramic path the Self canonly be attained when the ego is purified to this level. The egohas to become so pure that ultimately the pure ego and the pureSoul come together.Ego and pride are separate things. The belief of ‘I am’ inthe right place (the Self) is not considered ego. To believe whatone is not (I am Chandulal) is ego. The ego becomes absolutelypure when there is no trace of anger, pride, illusion or greed left.In the Kramic path a person progresses through acts ofpenance; he progresses by attaining the next higher level andrenouncing the lower one; both these actions co-exist in theKramic path but no matter what one renounces, the ego alwaysremains. Not only that, the ego increases with the sense of, ‘Ihave renounced.’ The path the world follows is the Kramic path.In it one moves forward one step at a time. It is a path ofacquisition and renunciation. But there is great danger in it alsobecause a person regresses tremendously if he mingles in thethe empire on his eldest son Bharat. Emperor Bharat becametired of fighting battles and his life in the palace with his thirteenhundred queens. So he approached Lord Rushabhdev andasked for diksha and moksha. The Lord said to him, “Who willtake care of the empire if you too leave the empire? Therefore,you will have to take care of it, but I will grant you ‘AkramGnan’, whereby you will not lose your moksha even if you fightbattles or rule the empire with your thirteen hundred queens.”The Lord bestowed upon him an astonishing Gnan (knowledge).That verily is the Akram Gnan. And this Gnan, the Gnan of LordRushabhdev is the Gnan ‘We’ bestow upon you in just one hour.‘We’ grant you this very Gnan and place it in the palm of yourhands! After Gnan you can continue to live your worldly life, getyour children married and do everything. You do not have toattain anything new nor renounce anything. Whatever needsrenouncing, ‘We’ do it for you. ‘We’ make you renounce yourattachment and ego and help you attain the state of the Self.Nothing remains to acquire or renounce after that. The ego ‘Iam Chandulal’ is removed and is replaced by the state, ‘I am apure Soul’, and all that needs to be acquired and renounced isaccomplished in this.Emperor Bharat had employed servants twenty-fourhours a day. They would ring a bell every fifteen minutes callingout, “Bharat beware, beware, beware!” Upon hearing this, if theemperor were lost in the relative world, he would immediatelycome back into awareness of the Self. But today how can youafford to hire servants when you yourself are working for minorwages? This is why ‘We’ establish within you, a ‘servant’ thatwill stay with you twenty-four hours. This servant will alert youevery moment of the day. ‘We’ establish the force of pragnya(direct light of the Self) within you and it will constantly keepknowledge (Gnan) separate from ignorance (agnan).One does not have the understanding of, ‘Who am I?’ Heknows he exists (astitva) but he does not have the awarenessAptavani-25960Aptavani-2of who he is (vastutva). If he were to attain the awareness ofwho he really is even for second, he can reach completion-liberation (purnatva). The Self is natural, the path to acquire theknowledge (of Who am I?) is straightforward and easy, but aGnani Purush is needed to give the knowledge of the Self andonly then can the Self be attained. The Gnani himself is liberatedand has the power to liberate others. He is called the savior, andthe fact that Akram Vignan has arisen in this current time cycleis a tremendous natural occurrence.

All one has to do is act out Chandulal’s drama, withequanimity and proceed towards liberation.In the Kramic path one has to decrease his ego(arambha) and possessiveness (parigraha, mamatva).Renunciation reduces one’s possessions and that in turn reducesattachment.

Otherwise, just a single association with thewrong company will make him fall countless steps.

On what basisare we calling this state of ours the twelfth spiritual stage? Wecall it so because you have attained shukla dhyan; you haveattained the Self! Shukla dhyan is to attain the awareness(laksha) and a continuous conviction (pratiti) of being the Soul.Aptavani-26768Aptavani-2In the Kramic path there is just a trace of this conviction, whichgradually becomes stronger. Then comes a stage where theconviction becomes firmly established and only when theconviction becomes complete, one is said to have attained thestate of kshayak samkit (permanent attainment of ‘I am theSoul’), whereas in this Akram path, the first thing one attains isthe awareness (laksha) of the Soul, and this conviction (pratiti)will always remain. In this Akram path the awareness isestablished first. In the Kramic path even though one attains theconviction (pratiti) of the Self, he does not attain shukla dhyan,because in the current time cycle, no one can proceed past theseventh gunthanu; seventh spiritual stage.In the Akram path, the Gnani Purush establishes acontinuous link of the right belief (kshayak samkit), which is whythe link of kashays (anger, pride, illusion and greed) cannotremain. There can only be presence of just one link, either theone that perpetuates kashays or the one that perpetuates theSelf.In the Kramic path, only when one attains gaaddhasamkit i.e. shuddha samkit (absolute conviction that ‘I am pureSoul’), is there a separation between the two (real and relative).One’s darshan mohaniya, the belief of ‘I am Chandulal’, stopsand what remains is the effects of discharging karma (charitramohaniya) i.e. the worldly life. Their efforts go towards are tocompleting their discharging karma.Nowadays however, people try to get rid of their charitramohaniya (effect; discharging karma) without destroying theirdarshan moha (cause; charging karma), how can that bepossible?Here in the Akram path, we deal all the dischargingkarmas with equanimity. When ‘We’ give you Gnan, ‘We’destroy your charge karma (darshan mohaniya karma; the beliefof ‘I am Chandulal’) and render your discharge karmas (charitramohaniya) unexciting, whereby they no longer fascinate you. Asa result, no new ‘taste or relish’ arises and hence no newdarshan moha will remain. Darshan mohaniya prevails becauseof the allure of the ‘taste’. Charging of new karma ceases whenthe effect of karma is rendered insipid and bland!In the Kramic path, the seeker has to work to rendereffects of his discharge karma (charitra mohaniya) insipid andthat is why he has to endure severe penance and renunciation.This results in charitra mohaniya becoming bland. He has to dophysical and visible penance like fasting, renunciation etc,whereas in the Akram path, our penance is internal (aantrik). Ininternal penance the inner ‘heart’ begins to heat up from 80degrees, 85 degrees, 95 degrees and ‘We’ know that it is notgoing to go beyond 99 degrees, because it is not a hot coal thatis going to catch the fire. This heat of the penance will graduallydecrease. For ‘us’, ‘We’ become the knower of all the phases,from the beginning of the heat till it cools down. That is our innerpenance.

When one comes tothis satsang once and attains the grace of the Gnani Purush andgets the visa of moksha (Gnan Vidhi) then amazing future livesare at hand. This life too will become easy. Such is the path ofAkram.There are only two paths, a worldly path and a spiritualpath. In the worldly path if you have medical questions youAptavani-26768Aptavani-2In the Kramic path there is just a trace of this conviction, whichgradually becomes stronger. Then comes a stage where theconviction becomes firmly established and only when theconviction becomes complete, one is said to have attained thestate of kshayak samkit (permanent attainment of ‘I am theSoul’), whereas in this Akram path, the first thing one attains isthe awareness (laksha) of the Soul, and this conviction (pratiti)will always remain. In this Akram path the awareness isestablished first. In the Kramic path even though one attains theconviction (pratiti) of the Self, he does not attain shukla dhyan,because in the current time cycle, no one can proceed past theseventh gunthanu; seventh spiritual stage.In the Akram path, the Gnani Purush establishes acontinuous link of the right belief (kshayak samkit), which is whythe link of kashays (anger, pride, illusion and greed) cannotremain. There can only be presence of just one link, either theone that perpetuates kashays or the one that perpetuates theSelf.In the Kramic path, only when one attains gaaddhasamkit i.e. shuddha samkit (absolute conviction that ‘I am pureSoul’), is there a separation between the two (real and relative).One’s darshan mohaniya, the belief of ‘I am Chandulal’, stopsand what remains is the effects of discharging karma (charitramohaniya) i.e. the worldly life. Their efforts go towards are tocompleting their discharging karma.Nowadays however, people try to get rid of their charitramohaniya (effect; discharging karma) without destroying theirdarshan moha (cause; charging karma), how can that bepossible?Here in the Akram path, we deal all the dischargingkarmas with equanimity. When ‘We’ give you Gnan, ‘We’destroy your charge karma (darshan mohaniya karma; the beliefof ‘I am Chandulal’) and render your discharge karmas (charitramohaniya) unexciting, whereby they no longer fascinate you. Asa result, no new ‘taste or relish’ arises and hence no newdarshan moha will remain. Darshan mohaniya prevails becauseof the allure of the ‘taste’. Charging of new karma ceases whenthe effect of karma is rendered insipid and bland!In the Kramic path, the seeker has to work to rendereffects of his discharge karma (charitra mohaniya) insipid andthat is why he has to endure severe penance and renunciation.This results in charitra mohaniya becoming bland.

Such is the path ofAkram.There are only two paths, a worldly path and a spiritualpath. In the worldly path if you have medical questions youAptavani-26970Aptavani-2cannot ask a lawyer and if you have legal questions, you cannotask a doctor. But here in the Akram path, you can askeverything. Ask anything you want to know and here you willget answers and solutions to all your problems. Here you haveto say, “I come to you seeking knowledge but if you cannot giveme what you have, what is the point?” Those who have nodesire for worldly things and are in search for the truth; it ispossible for them to attain everything here from ‘us’. Here youcan ask and you will get. But alas! You do not even know whatto ask for. Ask for something that will remain with you eternally.Ask for the eternal. If you ask for temporary things, how longwill they last? Ask for something that will give you eternal peace,ask so you become eternally free from all worries and sufferingfrom all sources. You will attain moksha here. If you do not useyour intellect, you will attain this knowledge. This satsang of ourshas been going on for ten years. In our satsang there arediscussions and deliberations, but no disputes or arguments. Thisis the only place where the intellect cannot work and has no value.This is the Akram path and so everything here is out in theopen, you will find immediate solutions to every topic. TheKramic path however is comparable to the gold thread aweaver weaves in a fine cloth. He weaves an ounce of gold intoforty pounds of cotton. Similarly, Gautam Swami wove theentire Lords’ spoken words in the form of sutras (aphorisms),but how can people of this time cycle extract an ounce of goldof the Lord’s spoken words from pounds and pounds ofsentences? No one has the capacity to do so. But here, ‘We’give you only the pure gold. ‘We’ have given all the answersstarting from the point of the state of ignorance to the point ofabsolute knowledge (Keval Gnan). How is karma charged?How is it discharged? How does everything in the universework? Who runs the world? Who are you? Who are all thesepeople? ‘We’ give answers to all such questions here.What is the nature of this spoken knowledge (shrutagnan)here? It is that which one has never heard before. Is this not theshrutagnan of the vitarag Lords? It verily is. It will take you tothe same destination the vitarag Lords have taken the listenersto, but their path was different; it was the Kramic path. Whereasthis is the path of Akram Vignan; this path is one wherein it isworth getting your work done. This is not a place of any religion.Here all aspects of your work (both real and relative) will beaccomplished. The work is accomplished only where moksha isreadily available. Here you will find knowledge that givescomplete solution and satisfaction in every situation. There mustbe complete satisfaction. If this knowledge (Gnan) does notsolve your problems, it means that you do not know how toresolve things; otherwise there must be complete satisfaction. Ifyou abide by my Agnas, you will have complete satisfaction. Inthis path, it does not matter whether you are clever or not; aclever person has pride about his cleverness; a scholar ofscriptures will have pride about his ability; a person whorenounces worldly things will have pride about his renunciation.This false pride (khumari, keyf) in itself is a horrible disease; itis a grave disease indeed. How can a person with such a diseasehelp others get rid of their disease? Here, all talks are directtalks (origin of the Self) of the vitarag Lords; there is not a singleindirect (intellectually mediated) word. They are talks of thetwenty-four tirthankaras. These words that come forth areapplicable collectively to all times: the past, the present and thefuture, therefore this is the collective message of all the twenty-four tirthankaras. Ego laden pride that afflicts ascetics and sagesis a chronic disease. There is no medicine for this terribleaffliction. For that ‘We’ have to ‘operate’ on them using sternwords in order to rid them of their disease. No one here getsoffended because every mahatma here trying to settle his or heraccounts with equanimity and they have been with me for thepast ten years or so. They all have the same viewpoint andopinion; there is never any difference of opinions here. Evenwhen they go on a pilgrimage together, there is no discord.Aptavani-26970Aptavani-2cannot ask a lawyer and if you have legal questions, you cannotask a doctor.

When we go to Aurangabad for satsang,almost eighty to a hundred people stay in the same hometogether, but there is never any dispute amongst anyone.Everyone lives together, dines together but no one can tell thatso many people are living together. Everything moves along verysmoothly, people have never seen or experienced such unity andharmony. Nowhere else in the world will you witness anythinglike this. A person can attain salvation even if he were to simplyobserve something like this. Furthermore, there are no lawshere. Gnan of the vitarag Lords is not where there are laws.There are no laws to be found where there is absoluteknowledge of the vitarag Lords. Everything runs on absolutehumility despite the fact that there are no laws regulatinganything. Those who want to spend money here do so, and yetno-body feels any lesser or greater. There is equality amongsteveryone. This path is awe-inspiring; it is truly a wonder, so getyour work done. For the past ten years, they have been writingdown every word ‘We’ have spoken and yet there is no office,secretary or any rules. Wherever words have been spoken, theyhave been recorded and preserved meticulously. And those withoffices have papers missing here and there.In the Kramic path the rule is that a gnani who hasattained 80% spiritual level will not prostrate in front of a gnaniwho has attained a spiritual level of 78%. As the Gnani of theAkram path, ‘we’ have attained a 100% spiritual level, but ‘we’would even bow down to a one with a 5% development. Whatobjection would one have when one has no ego left? ‘Our’vision is only that of the Self. Why do ‘We’ prostrate in front ofa gnani with a lesser spiritual development? It is to make himwise and to show him, ‘Maharaj, your way is not correct.’There is no scope of ego arising within ‘us’ however because itwould do so within him, ‘we’ would not go to them without areason. Otherwise, their disease would worsen.From the time of Lord Rushabhdev up until now, theGnanis of the Kramic path will have two or three disciples. Theywill take care of their three disciples. The Gnanis themselvesundergo penance and make their disciples do the same.According to history, there have not been more than threedisciples. And yet after one million years, this Akram path hasarisen for those with the best of punyas (punya-anubandhi-punya, effect of merit karma). Nothing can be attained withouta living (pratyaksh) Gnani. Science of the vitarag Lords can beof no use without a living Gnani. And this is Akram Vignan,which gives instant results. In the Kramic path, even afterenduring severe penance, one does not experience the rewardinstantly, whereas here one does and it is cash.Who amongst three and a half billions in this world wouldnot want Gnan such as this? But, this knowledge is not meantfor everyone, it is only for those who are blessed with the bestof punyas. Surely people’s punyas have something to do withthe reason this Akram Gnan arose! This path has come aboutfor those with tremendous punya as well as for those who havebeen the devotees of the Lord; those who have becomecompletely dependant on Him but have been wandering in vain.It is also for those who just happen to spontaneously come tothis satsang and ask for this Gnan with a sincere heart; ‘we’ giveGnan to them. But we do not have to go around telling peopleabout this Gnan. The salvation of this world will come throughthis Dada and the enlightened atmosphere of his mahatmas.‘We’ are only instrumental in the process and not the doer.

But ‘we’ readily give Gnan to those who end upspontaneously in this satsang with their ‘passport’ of punya.The one who attains the grace of Dada has attainedeverything.Everyone that comes here is suffering, some five percent,some more, but their suffering is all the same. They also bringsuch good punyas along with them that all they have to do is sitin Dada’s lift and go to moksha! One meets Dada after heaccumulates punyas of millions of lifetimes. After that no matterhow severe a depression a person has, it will leave. This verilyis the place to get rid of depression. For those who are trappedor have depression, this is the place. Here such chronic ailmentsleave.Five hundred years from now people will sing about thisAkram Vignan. They will cherish and sing Kavi’s pados (spiritualsongs of Dada’s Science). Currently people are caught up on amerry-go-round of their own, but later they will look for thispath. How do these people on a merry-go-round see things?When we tell them about this Akram path, they will say, “I knoweverything.” And if you ask them whether they have worries andanxieties, they will say, “Everyone has worries.” If you claim toknow everything, then why would you have worries? To knowmeans to have light. How can you trip and fall or bump intothings when there is light? But they clash every step of the wayand yet they claim they know everything. You poor people,when will you ever solve your problems? When someone comesto ‘us’ with arrogance about what he knows, ‘we’ tell him,“Dear man, your vessel is full. What is the point of adding ‘our’nectar in it? If ‘we’ did, it will overflow and spill on the ground.If you come to ‘us’ as an empty pot, ‘we’ will fill it with ‘our’nectar and only then will ‘our’ nectar help you.”Questioner : Dada, will this path of Akram continue inyour absence?Dadashri : This Akram path will last for a couple ofgenerations after ‘we’ are gone. (Dadashri came forth with thesewords in 1974. Later in 1977, he said that the Akram Pathwould continue for as long as there is a presence of true seekersof liberation in this world). After that, things will be the way theywere. Nevertheless, ‘we’ will be instrumental in raising theKramic path to newer heights. There will be new scriptures;everything will be new. Things will not be in the state of ruins asthey are today.This is the Akram path. Therefore, within just one hour,the Gnani breaks your belief of the worldly life as being thereality and establishes it in the actual reality of the Self. That iswhy, Kavi has written:“Never has there been knowledge like this in a million years.Forgotten was this real knowledge, never spoken of before.”This has never happened before and that is precisely whythis path is such a wonder. And if in this path one attains theticket of liberation, then his work is done. This path is for thosewith a lot of punya. Otherwise even after taking countless tauntsand sufferings from mother-in-laws and husbands, liberation isnot possible. Liberation is not that easy. It is only because thereis a presence of the Gnani Purush that it has become so. Thescriptural writers have emphasized and praised in glorious termsthe Gnani Purush as the giver of liberation.‘We’ are not the Lord of salvation; ‘we’ are merelyinstrumental in the process, and those who have the punya willreap the benefit without doing anything.

Only later, when people read aboutAkram Vignan in the history books, will they wonder whether76Aptavani-2Aptavani-275they were around during the time this Akram path was active.Then upon further investigation, they will discover that they weretoo busy building high-rise apartments. All other circumstancesmay come together, but it is not possible for one to becomeestablished on this Akram path. The circumstances that cometogether here are that of the eternal (sat). One will realize onlythe day after he receives the Self in the Gnan Vidhi.It has now been twenty-five hundred years since LordMahavir’s nirvana (final liberation), and yet it is amazing to seesuch a phenomenal ‘instrument’ manifest as a path to liberation.Otherwise how is Akram Vignan even possible? Twenty-fivehundred years after Lord Mahavir, these instruments would ariseand this change will occur. People had made a request to theLord asking Him to increase His lifespan in order to savehumanity from the destructive effects of the approaching timecycle and from the influence of the planet Bhasmak on the earthand on people. But the Lord said no; He said people will haveto suffer till the final degradation of human interaction. When itwill reach to the peak, that too will give results. This difficult timeis now coming to an end. And the end result is this Akram path,otherwise how can Akram possibly exist?Occasionally, in a million years, there arises a phenomenalhuman being who has to say all this himself. ‘We’ are giving youthis absolute assurance that there is no superior over you. Thereis absolutely no one in a position of power over you, so is thereany reason for you to be afraid?A person, in whom all internal states of easiness anduneasiness (akudata-vyakudata) cease, is always in a state ofbliss (nirakudata) or antarang pacchakhaan (antarang meansaantrik meaning internal. Pacchakhaan means pratyakhyan,which is a vow to never err; never to enter the domain of thenon-self). The gnanis of the Kramic path are always in the stateof easiness and uneasiness. The Kramic path is a factory ofeasiness-uneasiness. And this path of Akram Vignan gives oneinstant positive results in all situations.Now there will be new experiences. You have seennothing yet from the hill you have climbed. But now you are freeto look and roam around. It will amaze you. Take as muchadvantage of it as you want. Each one will gain according to hisspiritual level and understanding. If one is not able to carry theload himself, ‘we’ will help him. This, Akram Vignan that hasarisen is very extraordinary and unique, so get your work done.‘The rain, which the entire universe yearned for has fallenduring the spell of torturous and unbearable heat!’-KaviThe rain of Gnan has fallen during a time of relentlesssuffering. During such a time every human being, be it an ascetic,an acharya, a monk, a nun or an ordinary person, are allsuffering. It is natural for it to rain during the rainy season, butto ‘rain’ during the ‘heat wave’ of the current cruel time cycle,is an exceptional phenomenon indeed! The rain, which wouldnever otherwise fall, is falling! This is where you have to get yourwork done.The vitarag Lords have two types of Gnan; Kramic andAkramic; Akramic is the one, which today has arisen around‘us’.* * * * *76Aptavani-2Aptavani-275they were around during the time this Akram path was active.Then upon further investigation, they will discover that they weretoo busy building high-rise apartments. All other circumstancesmay come together, but it is not possible for one to becomeestablished on this Akram path. The circumstances that cometogether here are that of the eternal (sat). One will realize onlythe day after he receives the Self in the Gnan Vidhi.It has now been twenty-five hundred years since LordMahavir’s nirvana (final liberation), and yet it is amazing to seesuch a phenomenal ‘instrument’ manifest as a path to liberation.Otherwise how is Akram Vignan even possible? Twenty-fivehundred years after Lord Mahavir, these instruments would ariseand this change will occur. People had made a request to theLord asking Him to increase His lifespan in order to savehumanity from the destructive effects of the approaching timecycle and from the influence of the planet Bhasmak on the earthand on people. But the Lord said no; He said people will haveto suffer till the final degradation of human interaction. When itwill reach to the peak, that too will give results. This difficult timeis now coming to an end. And the end result is this Akram path,otherwise how can Akram possibly exist?Occasionally, in a million years, there arises a phenomenalhuman being who has to say all this himself. ‘We’ are giving youthis absolute assurance that there is no superior over you. Thereis absolutely no one in a position of power over you, so is thereany reason for you to be afraid?A person, in whom all internal states of easiness anduneasiness (akudata-vyakudata) cease, is always in a state ofbliss (nirakudata) or antarang pacchakhaan (antarang meansaantrik meaning internal. Pacchakhaan means pratyakhyan,which is a vow to never err; never to enter the domain of thenon-self). The gnanis of the Kramic path are always in the stateof easiness and uneasiness. The Kramic path is a factory ofeasiness-uneasiness. And this path of Akram Vignan gives oneinstant positive results in all situations.Now there will be new experiences. You have seennothing yet from the hill you have climbed. But now you are freeto look and roam around. It will amaze you. Take as muchadvantage of it as you want. Each one will gain according to hisspiritual level and understanding. If one is not able to carry theload himself, ‘we’ will help him. This, Akram Vignan that hasarisen is very extraordinary and unique, so get your work done.‘The rain, which the entire universe yearned for has fallenduring the spell of torturous and unbearable heat!’-KaviThe rain of Gnan has fallen during a time of relentlesssuffering. During such a time every human being, be it an ascetic,an acharya, a monk, a nun or an ordinary person, are allsuffering. It is natural for it to rain during the rainy season, butto ‘rain’ during the ‘heat wave’ of the current cruel time cycle,is an exceptional phenomenon indeed! The rain, which wouldnever otherwise fall, is falling! This is where you have to get yourwork done.The vitarag Lords have two types of Gnan; Kramic andAkramic; Akramic is the one, which today has arisen around‘us’.* * * * *Aptavani-27778Aptavani-2Prakruti : The relative selfThere is infinite energy in each Soul. There are infiniteSouls and there are infinite prakrutis (non-self complex).Within there are two components. They are: the Self(purush) and the non-self (prakruti). When one resides in thenon-self, one is weak. Once the Self is realized, then he is thesupreme Self. Ignorance of the supreme Self is why he isovercome with weaknesses of anger, pride, illusion (deceit) andgreed.As the Self we all have the same nature, but as prakruti,we are all different. Some people may have a sweet disposition,some temperamental, some may have an angry disposition;nevertheless these are the faults of the prakruti. A person will beable to renounce when the prakruti makes him renounce andwhen it makes him acquire, he will be able to acquire. Onedances according to the dance of the prakruti, and yet he says,“I danced.” Is this not an illusion (bhranti)? This is the amazingthing: it is the effect of past karma that drives one to do thingsand yet one claims, “I did this. I did that.” This verily is theillusion. Unless one becomes the Self, he is merely a top that isspinning as dictated by his prakruti and his past karma. How canhe claim to be the doer when he has not even realized who hereally is? Who is the doer? Who are you? You do not know this.So how can you say, “I did it?” You cry because the prakrutimakes you cry, and yet you say, “I am crying.” You laugh whenthe prakruti makes you laugh, but you say, “I am laughing.” Youget angry when the prakruti makes you angry but you say, “I amangry.” Prakruti forces you to do things and yet you say you arethe doer, how can you say that? And yet this is exactly whateveryone says; that is a wonder in itself.The phase (avastha) of the prakruti is temporary. All thatis perceived through the five senses are phases of the prakruti.There are eternal elements (tattva) in the world and theseelements (dravya) have their properties (guna) as well asphases (avastha, paryaya). The elements are eternal, but theirprakrut phases are temporary.Prakruti is productive by nature (prasavdharmi), which iswhy it has become so prolific.Questioner : What do you mean by prakruti isprasavdharmi?Dadashri : Let me explain. If you put up mirrors allaround this room, you will see a hundred and fifty people in thereflection. Did someone go in there and create one hundred andfifty people? Thus one can project into infinity. So countlessmore effects are created from just a single effect. Then thesuffering ensues. Everything in this universe is in the form ofvibrations (spandano). Just a single vibration will createcountless new ones. But if one stops emitting vibrationsaltogether, none will come back to him in return.The properties of the prakruti are of the non-self; they arenot of the Self. The world believes the properties of the non-selfas being that of the Self. They will say, “That man is very nice”,but if that man becomes sick and delirious, they will say, “He isnot a nice man.” Prakrutik properties will disappear in time. TheLord has said no matter how great a person’s disposition,whether he is compassionate or ill tempered; they are all traitsof the prakruti. There is no telling when they will change.Prakruti itself is made up of kapha, pitta and vayu.

Knowing both the real and the relativeis knowledge through pragnya i.e. the direct light of the Self,and to know just one viewpoint is knowledge through theintellect or buddhi, which is the indirect light of the Self mediatedthrough the ego.When a man abandons his wife and children and becomesan ascetic, he is not the one who is renouncing, but his prakrutiforces him to do so. It is the prakruti that makes a personrenounce worldly things or undergo penance, but the ego claims,‘I renounced’ or ‘I am doing penance’ or ‘I am doing samayik’.Prakruti controls and runs everything until one becomes aPurush (the Self). Reading scriptures, meditation, doing samayiketc., is prakrutgnan i.e. it is relative knowledge; it is notAtmagnan; it is not real knowledge. Prakrutgnan prevailseverywhere in the world.

When will you achieve that?Whereas here we say that the Soul is eternally free and separatefrom the good habits and the bad habits of the prakruti. In theAkram path we simply walk away from this ‘shop’ of therelative self by saying, “This shop is not mine”, whereas in otherpaths they make you empty the shop one item at a time.

Humanbeings have become unnatural. Everything is in its innatenatural state, including the Self. Only the prakruti of humanbeings has become unnatural and that is why the worldly selfappears unnatural. When the relative self becomes unnatural,so will the prakruti.

You fool, why don’t you becomenatural and spontaneous? To become natural means to actaccording to what the prakruti tells you. Prakruti does notindulge in the pleasures of the senses (vishayee), if it did, wewould see this in the animals too. Indulgence in sense pleasureis an unnatural characteristic (vikrut) that human beings haveacquired. Prakruti is in a natural state; it needs simple food toeat, it does not ask for elaborate foods. It asks for a simple mealof rice and lentils, it does not ask for dhokla (sour and sweettaste). It wants a balance of all the six tastes or flavors (abalanced intake) and it can obtain them naturally, but the humanprakruti will start asking for gourmet meals.

Instead, if a rose bush is bloomingbut not the plumeria, one will cut off the limbs of the plumeriatree. But if they are patient, they will enjoy the fragrance of allthe flowers. Every prakruti will blossom. When people see arose bush, but no roses on it, they will say this bush has thornsso just dig it up. No, the bush has thorns but along with thethorns, there must be some good qualities to it, such is the lawof nature. So, be patient. There will blossom a rose amongst thatbush of thorns.Some fathers hit their children. You fools!

If a prakruti is bad inone aspect, it is good in another. This is the way it always is.Its like this, if there were just a drummer in a band, howcan you call it a band?

Now in this Kaliyug, one person will behot tempered, another mild, another will have a differentpersonality altogether. That is why people cannot get along. Thehusband rises early in the morning, the wife gets up late and sothe bickering will start early in the morning. This is how theworldly life becomes bitter. However, problems will be solved ifone learns to adjust with different prakrutis.You can give compliments, you can say ‘the meal isgood’, but do it in a dramatic manner. You can give complimentsto make the other person feel good. But if there is too much saltin the kadhee and you say, “The kadhee is too salty”, then it willhurt the other person’s ego. It is acceptable for you to commenton the kadhee provided you know how to say it, but otherwiselook for other solutions. Discretely add water to it then drink it.Now that you have this Gnan, drink whatever the world servesyou. Tremendous energies exist within you. Prakruti will drinkthe salty kadhee, and You (the Self) are the observer. No onecan act beyond the prakruti. Even before ‘we’ attained thisGnan, the knowledge and insight of how ‘we’ should adjust tosituations was always at hand. All solutions would be present onthe moment.Because the world exists, everything else will be there forsure. Just because there are tiny stones in the wheat, does thatmean one should not buy wheat? No, one should buy the wheatbut pick out the stones and the grit and eat the wheat. Prakrutibecomes stuck wherever it meets with obstacles. So, whereverthe prakruti gets stuck, just focus Your (the Self) light there andbecome aware of what those obstacles are. You must see everymistake of yours. Lord Mahavir too used to observe only hisown prakruti and what it was doing.When you have to do something against your wishes, allyou need to do is simply know that you have to undertake thetask even though you do not wish to. In this situation it meansthe prakruti is ‘riding’ (controlling) you. You should not letprakruti ride over you. Prakruti was not meant to ride us, whichis why you must make prakruti the ‘horse’ and then ride it andtake the reins in your own hands.

Lord Mahavir too used to observe only hisown prakruti and what it was doing.When you have to do something against your wishes, allyou need to do is simply know that you have to undertake thetask even though you do not wish to. In this situation it meansthe prakruti is ‘riding’ (controlling) you. You should not letprakruti ride over you. Prakruti was not meant to ride us, whichis why you must make prakruti the ‘horse’ and then ride it andtake the reins in your own hands. If the ‘horse’ does not move,Aptavani-28586Aptavani-2then you can hit it with a hunter and tell it to move, then it will.All the bad habits that you have acquired from countless pastlives are your obstacles and that is why the prakruti has takencontrol. The Self is not like that. However the prakruti itself issaying, “God please take charge”, but because people do notunderstand, they give prakruti the upper hand.Even the most expensive well-bred horse will stop deadin its tracks upon seeing a green cloth covering a grave. It willrefuse to move and disregard all the prodding from the master.This sudden break within is an atkan, an inner obstruction. Thisverily is the intense temptation of the ‘devil’ within. One will gothat direction knowing well that it is wrong and harmful. Peopletoo have also developed such strong inner obstruction (atkan)like the horse. They get stuck in situations in life. One will haveto overcome this inner blockade, will he not?You should not let the prakruti have the upper hand; itshould not even have an option! Instead, you should take chargeand rule with ease.If someone tells ‘us’ to go to the final station (death), then‘we’ are ready, and if they say, “Let’s go to a wedding”, then‘we’ are ready. Prakruti should be kept ready. Instead, peoplewaste away hours contemplating not to do a certain task, butend up doing it anyway because they have no choice. It is betterto become natural and spontaneous. Vyavasthit, scientificcircumstantial evidence will not spare anyone, so becomespontaneous and natural.Kavi has written:‘Atkan thi latkan, latkan thi bhatkan‘Atkan will destroy one’s current life, and the effects lead tocountless wandering and suffering in future lives.Bhatkan ni chhatkan par chhanto charan-raj kan.’The only way to escape from this wandering is tosurrender at the feet of the Gnani Purush.’Once You (the Self) identify your atkan, it startsdisintegrating gradually. The prakruti is amazing, but one doesnot know how to extract right work out of it. Instead, onebecomes the prakruti, which is why when the ‘prakruti horse’runs in a certain direction; he too run with it. Instead why nottake the reigns in your hands and then you can roam whereveryou want with ease.The prakruti is orderly and regular (niyamit). The minddoes not have any order or regularity (aniyamit). A personsteals a wallet and gets thirty rupees from it. He gives five rupeesto a leper and the remaining twenty-five to his sister. This is whatthe mind is like. The nature of the mind is such that one momentit steals and the next it gives to charity. It is contradictory innature but prakruti is without contradiction and predictable. Ifyou can understand prakruti, you will be able to control it. Soyou must try to understand it completely.There is no problem if prakruti does things within thesocial norms. For example people will not condemn you if youeat snacks and drink tea but there is a problem if the actions ofyour prakruti are not accepted by society. If You (the Self) keep‘seeing’ such a prakruti, it will weaken. The more you observeit, the more it will dissolve.If a man comes to fight with you and he has a knife, if youmake an eye contact with him, he will become weak. If youkeep looking into his eyes, he will go away and not return. If heis strong and your energy weakens against him, he willoverpower you. But here, we have the divine eyes (divyachakshu,the vision of the Self). When even ordinary eyes can overpowerthe other person, what can you not accomplish with your divineeyes? The divine eyes can dissolve the prakruti!There is neither a restriction nor an order for anyone to‘go’ to moksha, but one must become aware of his own Self.Aptavani-28586Aptavani-2then you can hit it with a hunter and tell it to move, then it will.All the bad habits that you have acquired from countless pastlives are your obstacles and that is why the prakruti has takencontrol.

He used to observe the science of theprakruti, nothing else. He used to observe only his own pudgal(the non-self complex of thoughts, speech and actions).The nature of prakruti is that of puran-galan (subject toinflow and outflow), and the Self is apuran-galan (devoid ofinflow and outflow).Even prakruti in the form of GodWhen the prakruti appears Godlike, then one will attainmoksha. When a pickpocket’s prakruti appears Godlike, he willattain moksha. Picking pockets is the prakruti’s doing. Thatprakruti too is God, but it is relative god (potential to becomeGod), whereas the Self is the real God. One does not have thisviewpoint to see the Lord within the prakruti because of theintellect (buddhi). The intellect says, “He picked my pocket. Hetook my money.” This is because the real view point is absent;is not known (one is not Self-realized). Otherwise, the Self, theSupreme Self resides within the pickpocket.

If one eats araw mango, he says it is sour; sourness is its prakruti. Thevitarags recognize and understand the differences in all prakrutisand are unaffected by it and that is why they do not botherwhether a mango is sour or sweet. They are never concernedabout the differences in prakruti, they remain vitarag (unattached)and indifferent. The Lord sees the pick pocketing as prakruti,and giving charity as prakruti as well.

Circumstancesare temporary but one believes them to be permanent.Prakruti rendered natural through GnanQuestioner : When prakruti becomes unnatural (vibhavik,asahaj), emotional, is it because more knots within begin toerupt? What exactly happens?Dadashri : Yes, but it happens only when one encountersthe evidence. A person may not collapse even if he feels slightlydizzy but if the evidences of dizziness persist, he will. BeforeGnan, say if you had to catch a train and when you got to thestation they told you the train would be fifteen minutes late, youwould wait. And later on, they told you the train would be lateby another half an hour so, again you would wait. But whatwould happen, if they told you the train would be delayed byanother half an hour?Questioner : I would become agitated and even cursethe people that work for the railway.Dadashri : The Gnan tells you that if the train is delayed,it is vyavasthit. ‘Avastha matra kudrati rachna chhe, jeno koibapoye rachnar nathi aney tey vyavasthit chhe - All states ofthe non-self are natural occurrences. No one is independentlyresponsible for their creation, and that is vyavasthit (scientificcircumstantial evidences).’ When You say this much then, withthe support of these Gnan words, You will be able to remain in‘your’ natural state. Since the beginning of time, prakruti makesone asahaj (unnatural and reactive). Now through Gnan, onebrings it to its natural state. In reality, prakruti is sahaj, naturaland spontaneous, but it becomes unnatural due to its tendencyto react to situations and circumstances (vibhavik bhaav),because of ignorance. It has to be brought back into its naturalstate through the support of Gnan. Once the interference(dakho) into the relative (I am Chandulal), i.e. the worldly selfceases prakruti becomes sahaj. The Self then remains in bliss asthe knower and the seer.If Gnan prevails then even if you have to spend entirenight waiting for the train, you will not have any problems.Whereas a person without Gnan will become so agitated thatwithin half an hour he will be cursing everyone. Is the train or theguard going to be affected by his cursing? No, one is onlyslinging mud onto his own self. If there is Gnan, then the Selfmerely remains the observer of the difficulties that arise in adifficult situation as well as the ease in an easy situation; thatverily is the sahaj Atma. This Gnan that ‘we’ have given you issuch that it will not agitate you in the least. There would be noproblems even if you were to be hung, because that too isvyavasthit. If that is going to happen then why not leave theworld laughingly instead of crying?Prakruti is reactive by natureThe nature of the prakruti is like the touch-me-not plant; themoment you touch the plant it withdraws its leaves. When you getfrustrated and tell your children, “I am tired of you”, his or herprakruti will instantly withdraw and pull away just like the plant.Therefore, you should tell your child, “I am not really tired of you”and remedy the situation, then he will not withdraw from you.Aptavani-28990Aptavani-2rest is dharma of the prakruti.

Evenif you overeat and get indigestion, you should not say, “I havea little indigestion”, because prakruti will react accordingly.Instead you should say, “No the food has been digested nicely.”When a husband is fed up with his wife he will tell her,“You make me berserk.” Instantly one has to say within, “No,not really. Others may lose their mind, but you do not hurt mein any way.” If one says only this much, the prakruti will notwithdraw (from the wife). If such an internal correction does notoccur, the prakruti will become strong and controlling in natureand will protest, “Who are you to interfere?” So we must saythe right words, internally.Prakruti will comply through reasoningNow that you have attained this Gnan, you should notwaste away a single moment in spiritual apathy. You do not haveto get angry at the prakruti or tell it off, you simply have to say,“I will give you whatever you want to eat, but please accept thisrequest of mine.” Tell the body, “Please accept this request ofmine.” If the ego is getting out of control, tell it, “Please acceptthis request of mine.”Questioner : What if you defy the prakruti Dada? Whatif you confront it?Dadashri : No, prakruti will oppose you if you oppose it.That is what it wants. It is waiting for you to defy it, so it can takeyou in its clutches. You should not do that. You have to reasonwith it and persuade it. It is like a child, no matter how old theprakruti, it is like a child. There is no telling where it will do wrongand upset everything, just like a child. Because it is childlike, youhave to reason with it, explain things to it, coax it, entice it, temptit, feed it its’ favorite food in order to get Your work done.Questioner : You mean we have to pamper it in order toget the work done?Dadashri : No, not pamper it, but by explaining things toit. Pampering the prakruti is a wrong approach; you have tomake it understand. Keep on doing so until it says ‘yes’ on itsown. You cannot accomplish anything until it understands.However, do not go against it, it will go off on the wrong trackif you do. If you keep hitting an ox, it will overturn your cart. Ifyou strike an ox, it will start running. You may think it isresponding to the beating, but you can never tell when it willoverturn your wagon. Instead it is better that you coax it gently.Prakruti is like a child, no matter how old it is. A person’sprakruti may behave like a mature adult all his life but there isno telling when it will turn childlike. It will cry, become indignant,it will whimper and whine; it does all sorts of thing, does it not?Questioner : Yes it does.Dadashri : Since the prakruti is childlike it is easy topersuade it, is it not?You need to accomplish your work by reasoning andexplaining things to the prakruti; in fact it is essential and then itwill say ‘yes’ to you, but until it agrees with you, everything youdo will be in vain.It may say ‘no’ to you for six months unrelentingly, yet ina matter of only fifteen minutes of making it understand, it willagree with you. It is like a child, and if it becomes obstinate, itmay never change even in a thousand years. There is a bigdifference between the prakruti becoming obstinate and makingit understand. It is a special skill and an art to make itunderstand. No matter how obstinate a child may be, if youhave the skills to explain things, then he will understand andobey. Otherwise the child will throw a tantrum. You must knowhow to do this. The presence of the Self within makes us learnall this easily after knowing the Self.

Instead people do not even bother looking forthe right solution, they have no clue and yet they go aroundforcing and pressuring the prakruti.If sugar is rationed on the market, the nature of theprakruti is such that it will become restless. It will becomerestless and keep goading you, “Let’s go buy sugar. Let’s gobuy some sugar because it is going to be rationed.” You can tellit that you will go when the rationing starts, but it will notconcede. Prakruti is like a child or like an obstinate old man. Asfar as reasoning with it is concerned, it is like a child. You cantalk to it, reason with it and it will understand, just as a childwould. We make it understand by giving it treats and candies.Questioner : In what sense do you mean the prakruti islike an old man?Dadashri : It is like an old man from the perspective thatit will not budge or give in no matter what challenges it has toface; it will remain firm and obstinate. And if it were to give in, itwill do so in no time. ‘We’ have ‘seen’ this. If the prakruti wereinanimate (jada) it would never let go; it would remain unperturbed,then it would be regarded as being vitarag (without feeling), butthe prakruti has been touched by chetan (the Self). It is amixture of both the animate and the inanimate (mishra chetan).What is mishra chetan? All the subatomic particles(parmanus) of the prakruti are called mishrasa (mixed parmanus).When mishrasa release their effects and dissipate, theseparmanus are called vishrasa (pure parmanus). With bhaav orintent, the pure parmanus becomes mixed again and this process(charging) is called prayogsha. (Charging parmanus are calledprayogsha. Atoms ready to give effect and whilst giving effect,are called mishrasa. After discharge, atoms become pure andare called vishrasa). The inherent attribute of the parmanus ofthe prakruti have attained chetan bhaav due to its closeproximity of the Self and therefore it is amenable to explanationsand internal conversations. If you speak with this tape recorder(inanimate object) or shout at it, is it going to understand?Although people have not realized the Self, their life doesgo on does it not? That is because the prakruti is a mixture ofthe Self and matter (mishrachetan). Do some people who arevery street-smart not get ripped off, sometimes? Why is that? Itis because of the prakruti; it takes someone who knows how toreason with the prakruti.Questioner : Sometimes, it does not work despitereasoning with them.Dadashri : That means one does not know how to makethem understand.Questioner : Many times, despite reasoning with theprakruti, it does not come around and so I have to reprimandit. For example, the doctor has told me to eat only two puris(fried bread) but when they serve mango pulp with puris, theprakruti will want to eat three puris. At such a time it will notlisten if I try to reason with it, and so I have to scold it. I cannotsweet-talk with it at that time; I have to be firm with it.Dadashri : It is like this, the best approach is to explainthings to it, but if that does not work, then you can reprimandit; but that is the second step. It is fine in matters of the bodybut where the mind is concerned, it is not good to reprimand it.The body is inanimate so there is no problem there, but wherethe mind is concerned, you have to reason with it. It is alsobetter to reason with the body if you know how. The body toolistens to us.Questioner : The more prakruti becomes natural themore easily it will agree and listen, is that so Dada?Dadashri : Yes that is true. What do all these parmanussay? They are associated with the properties of the Self and soAptavani-29394Aptavani-2long enough the answer will come to you intuitively, providingyou look within. Instead people do not even bother looking forthe right solution, they have no clue and yet they go aroundforcing and pressuring the prakruti.If sugar is rationed on the market, the nature of theprakruti is such that it will become restless. It will becomerestless and keep goading you, “Let’s go buy sugar. Let’s gobuy some sugar because it is going to be rationed.” You can tellit that you will go when the rationing starts, but it will notconcede. Prakruti is like a child or like an obstinate old man. Asfar as reasoning with it is concerned, it is like a child. You cantalk to it, reason with it and it will understand, just as a childwould. We make it understand by giving it treats and candies.Questioner : In what sense do you mean the prakruti islike an old man?Dadashri : It is like an old man from the perspective thatit will not budge or give in no matter what challenges it has toface; it will remain firm and obstinate. And if it were to give in, itwill do so in no time. ‘We’ have ‘seen’ this. If the prakruti wereinanimate (jada) it would never let go; it would remain unperturbed,then it would be regarded as being vitarag (without feeling), butthe prakruti has been touched by chetan (the Self). It is amixture of both the animate and the inanimate (mishra chetan).What is mishra chetan? All the subatomic particles(parmanus) of the prakruti are called mishrasa (mixed parmanus).When mishrasa release their effects and dissipate, theseparmanus are called vishrasa (pure parmanus).

They are associated with the properties of the Self and soAptavani-29596Aptavani-2they say, “We have not come here for your scolding.” This is alla science; when You scold the prakruti, you will see resultsimmediately.Questioner : Previously when I lived with a Jain ascetic,I was very strict with my appetite and eating habits. I punishedmy appetite tendencies very severely and it took six monthsbefore it succumbed to me. Now I am experiencing a reactionto that and for the last eight years, if I do not get food on time,just once, it starts shouting within and on the outside.Dadashri : Just look at how worn out these people havebecome. All the ascetics, sages etc., have become exhaustedbecause they have tried to suppress and stifle their minds. Themind is not a thing you can stifle; neither can you let it roam free.It is wrong to leave it free to roam. Both approaches are wrong.Questioner : Do both need to be in proportion?Dadashri : No, not in proportion. If your son’s wife wereto come here, do you not have certain restraint and limitations?Questioner : Yes Dada, I do.Dadashri : If your daughter-in-law is passing by and youstop her in a commanding tone and start questioning her abouther college and her personal activities, it is all harmful. This isletting the mind run lose. You have to exercise some restraintover the mind. You must not let your influence over your mindbe lost. That is why you should deal with it in a meaningfulmanner. You should not let it run free but neither should you getupset with it. What would happen if you were to treat the womenin your household like that? They would lose respect for you.There is a Gujarati saying, ‘If the father-in-law respectshis boundaries, so will the daughter-in-law.’ This is how thingsare, so you should deal with the mind in a methodical and asystematic manner. The mind has overturned everyone and thatis why the ascetics and sages struggle in all they do. The momentthey become someone’s guru, they tumble so hard that they endup being a disciple of a disciple, who is a disciple of anotherdisciple. This is because the mind can easily topple them; themind has tremendous power. What does the mind do when acontrol of any kind is exercised?Questioner : It evades control; it becomes unrestrainedand careless.Dadashri : Because, to do so goes against its nature. Themind says, “Do not obstruct me.”Questioner : A guru is needed at that very moment.Dadashri : Yes, how can anything be accomplishedwithout a guru? How can a person accomplish anything on hisown?Questioner : A guru is needed for sure when the mindis inclined to wander according to its tendencies.Dadashri : No one has gone to moksha without a guru.Only the tirthankaras who became spontaneously enlightenedwere able to do so, but they too had a guru in their previous life.Through that guru, they were given the vision of the knowledgeand that is why they had no problems. But ordinary people aredoomed for sure without a guru. If there is no guru overhead,one will act according his self-guided will and intellect(swachhand).The mind should be impressed and in awe of Your‘presence’. Let me explain to you what this is like. If someonecomes looking to beat up this man here, the moment that personsees me, he will not be able to do or say anything. Why is that?It is because of my prabhav; my presence, aura and influence.I do not have to say anything. The ‘presence (prabhav)’ itselfwill do the work.

If you have the respect ofpeople in your home, are they likely to go against you?Questioner : No.Dadashri : In the same way, your mind should have agood impression of you, it should respect you.

Furthermore, they will not hurtanyone in the least. ‘Our’ words are easy to digest and they donot cause any ‘indigestion’ later. ‘These’ words are thecomplete essence of pure knowledge. Not a single word of theGnani will be fruitless. There is tremendous and extraordinarypower in the Gnani’s speech. The world will leap with awe atevery word of the Gnani. Even just one sentence of the Gnaniwill take you to moksha. Every word of ‘Ours’ has life (chetan– the Self) in it. Speech is a record and it is inanimate, but ‘this’speech expresses after having touched the fully enlightened Lordwithin. That is why it has the power to liberate worldly beings;it has the power of turning the nischetan into chetan i.e. therelative self into the real Self. All that is needed is the seeker’sdesire for it. If ‘we’ tell a person to jump, he will jump even aten-foot hole. This is why many people say, “You are doingshaktipat (transfer of energy).” No that is not so, but thesewords have this inherent energy.

There istremendous energy in the words of the Gnani.Kavi has sung:“Jagat udaya avatar, deshna tey shrutagnanSyadvad Gnan-daan, sarvamaanya parman”When the world is ready to prosper, a Gnani will manifest.Gnani’s speech when heard is the gift of knowledge whichliberates and this knowledge is accepted by all.A Gnani manifests when the time is good for the world.His words (deshna) liberate and represent the knowledge meantto be heard (shrutagnan). A single sentence of His encompassesvolumes of scriptures.It is written in the scriptures that one must always speakthe truth but people say they are not able to do so. People arelooking for scriptures that are applicable to the era of currentthis time cycle of Kaliyug so that they can get their work done.New scriptures will be written that will prevent the deleteriouseffect of the current time cycle upon people and take them tomoksha. The ‘medicine’ the scriptures preach to us, to speakthe truth, to be kind, to keep peace etc., is outdated medicine.Now we will need new medicine. Your intent (bhaav) must beto speak only the truth, and if you make a mistake, you have totell ‘Chandubhai’ to do pratikraman. ‘Our’ words will break allveils of ignorance; the power of the Gnani’s speech is such thatit gives complete clarification within. You forget the world and theworldly life when you sit with me here, which verily is moksha.‘Our’ speech is pratyaksh (direct) Saraswati; it is livingand directly present Saraswati (Goddess of speech). TheGoddess Saraswati you see in pictures, books and scriptures isan in-direct form (paroksha). If you want to do darshan of thereal presence of Saraswati, you can do so by listening to thisspeech.‘We’ (Gnani Purush and the fully enlightened Lord within)are not the speaker of everything being said here; ‘We’ are notthe speaker of even a single word. Really, it is your punya (meritkarma) that causes these words to come forth. ‘We’ are able toassess your punyas based on the speech that comes out. Thisspeech is a record; ‘We’ have nothing to do with it. What is thisspeech like? It is completely syadvad; it is speech that does nothurt anyone, not in the least, and one that accepts everyviewpoint. Such is this speech, absolutely syadvad.What is the definition of the worship of Saraswati? Itmeans to not abuse (apvyaya) the speech in any way or form.It means to not abuse speech or utter speech that is spoken forselfish reasons.

There istremendous energy in the words of the Gnani.Kavi has sung:“Jagat udaya avatar, deshna tey shrutagnanSyadvad Gnan-daan, sarvamaanya parman”When the world is ready to prosper, a Gnani will manifest.Gnani’s speech when heard is the gift of knowledge whichliberates and this knowledge is accepted by all.A Gnani manifests when the time is good for the world.His words (deshna) liberate and represent the knowledge meantto be heard (shrutagnan). A single sentence of His encompassesvolumes of scriptures.It is written in the scriptures that one must always speakthe truth but people say they are not able to do so. People arelooking for scriptures that are applicable to the era of currentthis time cycle of Kaliyug so that they can get their work done.New scriptures will be written that will prevent the deleteriouseffect of the current time cycle upon people and take them tomoksha. The ‘medicine’ the scriptures preach to us, to speakthe truth, to be kind, to keep peace etc., is outdated medicine.Now we will need new medicine. Your intent (bhaav) must beto speak only the truth, and if you make a mistake, you have totell ‘Chandubhai’ to do pratikraman. ‘Our’ words will break allveils of ignorance; the power of the Gnani’s speech is such thatit gives complete clarification within. You forget the world and theworldly life when you sit with me here, which verily is moksha.‘Our’ speech is pratyaksh (direct) Saraswati; it is livingand directly present Saraswati (Goddess of speech). TheGoddess Saraswati you see in pictures, books and scriptures isan in-direct form (paroksha). If you want to do darshan of thereal presence of Saraswati, you can do so by listening to thisspeech.‘We’ (Gnani Purush and the fully enlightened Lord within)are not the speaker of everything being said here; ‘We’ are notthe speaker of even a single word. Really, it is your punya (meritkarma) that causes these words to come forth. ‘We’ are able toassess your punyas based on the speech that comes out. Thisspeech is a record; ‘We’ have nothing to do with it. What is thisspeech like? It is completely syadvad; it is speech that does nothurt anyone, not in the least, and one that accepts everyviewpoint. Such is this speech, absolutely syadvad.What is the definition of the worship of Saraswati? Itmeans to not abuse (apvyaya) the speech in any way or form.It means to not abuse speech or utter speech that is spoken forselfish reasons. To lie is to abuse speech.For a Kshatriya, his word is his bond. A Kshatriya willAptavani-2103104Aptavani-2always be true to his word. Currently there is no such person inthe entire city of Bombay! Arey! Leaving aside word of mouth,nowadays even when people sign documents they will claim,“This is not my signature!” A true Kshatriya will never go backon his word.The poets and bards have such sweet language evenwhen they worship the Goddess Saraswati in a picture!Goddess Lakshmiji (Goddess of wealth)Questioner : What are Goddess Lakshmiji’s rules?Dadashri : Her rules are that one cannot make or takemoney dishonestly. How can Lakshmiji be pleased with you ifyou violate this rule? Then it matters little whether you worshipGoddess Lakshmiji to no end. It is of no consequence when youperform the ritual of washing coins on Lakshmipujan Day priorto Diwali! Everyone does that too! Do they wash coins inEngland?Questioner : No Dada, no one washes money there.Dadashri : Even then does Lakshmiji not grace theirhomes? What is the meaning in washing coins? Here in India,people wash them with yogurt also! Everyone washes coins.When it comes to money, everyone is shrewd; no one lagsbehind in doing this. People even come and ask me, “Did youwash coins today?” ‘We’ ask, “What for?” Whenever Lakshmijimeets me ‘we’ tell her, “Our home address is 6, Mamani Poda,Vadodara. You are welcome there anytime it is convenient foryou. It is your home, so you are welcome.” This is all ‘we’ sayto her; ‘we’ never fail to show ‘our’ respect. Where money isconcerned ‘we’ never say ‘we’ have no need for money.You cannot shun Lakshmiji (money). Many ascetics,sages, monks etc., will say ‘No! No!’ when someone offersthem money. They are doomed to spend many lifetimes withouta penny when they react this way. You fools, do not shun LLakshmiji in this way otherwise, you will not have theopportunity to even touch money again. You will not be able todo even darshan of Lakshmiji in your next life. You cannot shutit. You cannot afford to shun anything. Shunning Lakshmiji issame as shunning the interactions of worldly life, that is why ‘we’say ‘Jai Sat Chit Anand’ to Lakshmiji when she comes to ‘our’home and also when she leaves. You have to tell her, “This isyour house, come and go as you please.” Lakshmiji says, “Thewealthy businessmen chase me so hard that they have sores ontheir feet. When they run after me they fall so many times andscrape their knees and they tell themselves it is not worthchasing money. But I entice them again and once more they getup and start chasing me. This is how I am going to beat themuntil they bruise and bleed. Their feet swell and yet they do notcome to their senses.” Lakshmiji is very shrewd.Nature of money in the current time cycleMoney of today is such that it comes as a result of pastmerit karma, but binds new demerit karma (paap-anubandhipunya) as it leaves; it is money that creates conflicts. Instead itis better that you have less money, which will at least preventconflicts from entering your home. Today, money creates anatmosphere of conflict wherever it goes. It is better to have asimple meal of vegetables and bhakhree (Indian bread) thanthirty-two varieties of delicacies. What use is eating food thatcreates quarrels while eating? Wealth of current times comes butit brings quarrels with it. Money of today will create misery andsuffering in its wake. Otherwise, even one rupee that is destinedto bind merit karma (punya-anubandhi-punya) will give peaceand happiness to everyone; it creates an atmosphere wherebyeveryone in the home will have positive and religious thoughts.What is the nature of money?

Change its flow fromall other directions to the path of religion. Whatever you spendtowards a worthy cause is worthwhile. Once God (Narayan)comes into your home so will Lakshmiji, how can sheotherwise? Where there is presence of God, there will be noquarrel, but there will be quarrels where Lakshmiji alone ispresent. People make a lot of money but they spend it onuseless things. Money is only to be spent on a worthy cause atthe hands of a person with merit karma. It requires merit karmato spend money towards a worthy cause.After 1942, there is no worth left in the money. Todaymoney is not being spent in the right places. It would be verygood if it were. Here now, liberation is all that is left for us.A vanik’s intellect teaches him money tricks. Vaniks willdonate one eighth of what they earn towards religion, becausethey think they will be rewarded for doing so. But even God haslearnt about their tricks to make money and so He says, you cango on making money, but you will not attain liberation.Nowadays people are throwing their money in the‘gutters’! Money that binds merit karma is money spent helpingspiritually elevated saints and sages.When a Kshatriya goes to the temple to do darshan, hewill put whatever money he has in his pocket in the donationbox, but a vanik with his intellect (buddhi), will decide ahead oftime how much he will donate! If he has a rupee note in hispocket, he will cash it and put ten paisas in the box!The nature of moneyQuestioner : How much money should we make?Dadashri : There is no hard and fast rule. When peopletake a bath in the morning, do they worry ahead of time, ‘Whatwill I do if I get only one pitcher of water today?’ In the sametoken, you should not be worrying about money that way. Theamount of water you are going to get for your bath has alreadybeen decided. If you were to get a bucket and half of water, noone can increase or decrease this amount. Therefore, make theeffort through your mind, speech and body to earn money, butdo not harbor a desire for it. Money is like a bank balance; youcan draw money out of your account only if you have a balance,right? To the one who harbors a desire for money, Lakshmijitells him, “You were meant to get some money in June, but nowyou will get it next July.” It is also a grave mistake to say ‘I don’twant any money’. You should neither shun Lakshmiji nor harbora desire for her. All you need to do is pay obeisance to her andmaintain respect and humility towards her. That humility isnecessary because she resides with the God.Lakshmiji will come to you without fail when the time isright but your desire for it will create an obstruction. Lakshmijisays, “You should carry on with your worldly life, I will send youmoney from time to time. I will forward your every draft on timebut at the same time do not harbor desire for me. Whatever youare destined to receive, I will send to you with interest. Thosewho harbor a desire, I will send them money late. Those whodo not harbor a desire will get their money on time.” Lakshmijialso says, “If you want liberation then take only the money thatis rightfully yours. Do not take anyone else’s money forcefully orthrough devious means.” Nevertheless one cannot gain experienceunless money comes and goes randomly and without thisexperience of profit and loss, one cannot go to moksha.Outflow of moneyQuestioner : Why do we run short of money?Dadashri : Shortage of money occurs because ofAptavani-2107108Aptavani-2It is fine as long as enough money comes to pay income tax.Questioner : What should ‘we’ do since it does not last?Dadashri : That is the nature of money; it will not last.But you should change its direction of flow.

When overtstealing stops, one is born into a morally upright family.Deceiving people is subtle stealing, that is considered severeraudradhyan and that results in a life in hell. It is severeraudradhyan when a cloth merchant overstretches the materialas he measures. There should be absolutely no tricks or deceitin what one does. A shopkeeper is deceiving his customerswhen he smiles and tells his customer that his goods are cleaneven when he knows they are contaminated and adulterated.And if you question his ethics he will say, “This is the only wayto do business.” A man of principles would tell his customers,“I only wish to sell pure goods, but this is not pure. You can buyit if you wish.” If the shopkeepers were to say just this much,they would be alleviated from any karmic liability.There is so much suffering in Bombay because peoplehave taken more than their share; they hoard more than whatthey are entitled to. A man who should be rightfully taking fivelakhs for himself is hoarding a hundred lakhs.Questioner : Money is temporary but even so, onecannot live without it. We need money even before we sit in thetrain.Dadashri : People cannot do without money. But havingmoney or not is also not under anyone’s control.

He would do satsangwherever he finds a room. He would even do satsang under atree. In an ashram, one need rules, kitchen, toilets etc. and thenthe worldly complications return. So why would ‘we’ take onsuch a problem?People eat and sleep in an ashram just as they do in theirown homes. Some stay in the ashram to do just that. ‘We’ donot have an ashram. ‘We’ are the owners of the whole universeand so all the towns are ours wherever ‘we’ go, are they not?There are no laws in ‘our’ satsangs. Here there is a ‘no-law law’. Akram means there are no laws. If there is a groupof people with no laws in this world, it is the group of Dada’sfollowers. They do not have any laws. The rest of the people inthe world cannot live without laws. The one living without lawsgoes to moksha. In the absence of laws, one becomes sahaj(natural and spontaneous) and in the presence of laws, hebecomes asahaj (unnatural).An excess or abundance of anything makes one loseinterest in it. Also where there is a control or restriction ofsomething, when it is rare one’s chit will go there repeatedly. Thechit will be preoccupied with sugar and when and how to get it,if it were to be rationed. Control is such a thing that it makes themind restless. That is why ‘we’ say to decontrol everything, takeaway all laws that control. Elsewhere people are preoccupiedwith trying to control their mind, which is precisely why the mindbecomes restless and agitated all day.The mind is such that it will develop a dislike towardsanything that becomes in excess. So then, how can you controlsuch a thing? When one tries to control and limit things they like,then the chit inevitably wanders there only. Such is the nature ofthe chit.If you tell a child, “Do not touch this”, his chit will remainstuck only there and he will not want anything else you give him.So, give children what they want. They are not going to takemore than what they are meant to, according to the laws ofvyavasthit. How much are they likely to take outside ofvyavasthit?We do not have rules here. Rules mean semi-control. Ifsomeone here says, “Why are you late? Come at four o’clocksharp.” the mind feels controlled, and therefore it will becomedamaged and spoilt. How free is the mind in the absence of anycontrol? When there was a control over the production ofcement, the price of cement went up to 32 rupees! After 1942,when rationing came into effect, people’s minds became spoilt.‘We’ do not scold anyone. ‘We’ do not say, “Why didyou bring this?” or “Why did you do this?” ‘We’ have made itso that no one will be scolded. ‘We’ have imposed the rule ofa no-law law. If a person were cooking with the cooking potupside down, ‘we’ would not say anything to them! They willlearn from their experience, will they not? One day, this worldwill have to get rid of all the rules and the laws. ‘We’ are thefirst one to do something about not having laws. ‘We’ will tellthe Government to come and see how our management runswithout any laws. How smoothly does our ten-day gathering of100 people in Aurangabad runs without any laws? We eat, wedrink tea and we have snacks! Elsewhere there are so manyrules. This company of ours is a company of people who haveno laws.Aptavani-2119120Aptavani-2The Law of ‘no laws’Many people ask me, “Dada, why don’t you open anashram?” However a Gnani Purush would not take on thetedious task of starting an ashram.

Some stay in the ashram to do just that. ‘We’ donot have an ashram. ‘We’ are the owners of the whole universeand so all the towns are ours wherever ‘we’ go, are they not?There are no laws in ‘our’ satsangs. Here there is a ‘no-law law’. Akram means there are no laws. If there is a groupof people with no laws in this world, it is the group of Dada’sfollowers. They do not have any laws. The rest of the people inthe world cannot live without laws. The one living without lawsgoes to moksha. In the absence of laws, one becomes sahaj(natural and spontaneous) and in the presence of laws, hebecomes asahaj (unnatural).An excess or abundance of anything makes one loseinterest in it. Also where there is a control or restriction ofsomething, when it is rare one’s chit will go there repeatedly. Thechit will be preoccupied with sugar and when and how to get it,if it were to be rationed. Control is such a thing that it makes themind restless. That is why ‘we’ say to decontrol everything, takeaway all laws that control. Elsewhere people are preoccupiedwith trying to control their mind, which is precisely why the mindbecomes restless and agitated all day.The mind is such that it will develop a dislike towardsanything that becomes in excess. So then, how can you controlsuch a thing? When one tries to control and limit things they like,then the chit inevitably wanders there only. Such is the nature ofthe chit.If you tell a child, “Do not touch this”, his chit will remainstuck only there and he will not want anything else you give him.So, give children what they want. They are not going to takemore than what they are meant to, according to the laws ofvyavasthit. How much are they likely to take outside ofvyavasthit?We do not have rules here. Rules mean semi-control. Ifsomeone here says, “Why are you late? Come at four o’clocksharp.” the mind feels controlled, and therefore it will becomedamaged and spoilt. How free is the mind in the absence of anycontrol? When there was a control over the production ofcement, the price of cement went up to 32 rupees! After 1942,when rationing came into effect, people’s minds became spoilt.‘We’ do not scold anyone. ‘We’ do not say, “Why didyou bring this?” or “Why did you do this?” ‘We’ have made itso that no one will be scolded. ‘We’ have imposed the rule ofa no-law law. If a person were cooking with the cooking potupside down, ‘we’ would not say anything to them! They willlearn from their experience, will they not? One day, this worldwill have to get rid of all the rules and the laws. ‘We’ are thefirst one to do something about not having laws. ‘We’ will tellthe Government to come and see how our management runswithout any laws. How smoothly does our ten-day gathering of100 people in Aurangabad runs without any laws? We eat, wedrink tea and we have snacks! Elsewhere there are so manyrules. This company of ours is a company of people who haveno laws.Aptavani-2121122Aptavani-2fights during the daytime and at night they would do pratikraman(asking for forgiveness as shown by Dada) in ‘our’ presence.They would create ‘stains’ against each other and then washthem off. This is a pure vitarag path, and so we have to do‘cash’ pratikraman (we should pay off our debts with ‘cash’ i.e.on-the-spot pratikraman for any mistakes we make and notleave any pending accounts). Here pratikraman is not donefortnightly or monthly but instantly, the moment faults occur. Iflaws and restrictions were imposed, people may not speak upbut it will create confusion and entanglements within them. ThisAkram Gnan is such that we have no laws here. As long as ‘we’are present, ‘we’ have given everyone the freedom of beingwithout laws.Everywhere in the world, the ascetics (sadhus andsanyasis) have laws and rules. They have to sit only in a certainway and do just certain things. Such rules cause sankalp andvikalp (determination and complications), whereas the Self issahaj, it is natural and spontaneous. Rules and restrictions arebondage. People make rules in their companies or groups andthese very rules cause bondage. Rules and restrictions are meantfor those who want to go from yama i.e. self-control or self-restraint towards niyam (rules and regulations and discipline).Yama is the first level and niyam is the second. We do not needlaws to go to moksha. For moksha, we need to let the self benatural and spontaneous. When you let the self be natural andspontaneous, you will experience natural and spontaneousliberation from within too.Here, there is no exchange of even a penny. We do notcollect money for ghee for the arti (prayer rituals). We do notask for money for printing books and yet it is amazing howeverything functions and moves along. When you involve moneyin religion, it becomes a futile undertaking and for that you needto have laws, offices and endless anxieties. Just see howpeaceful everyone is because there are no laws here. If you goGod is not to be found amongst people who have rigidrules; He is to be found where there are no rules or regulations.He will even be amongst thieves provided they have no rules. Itis because people have harmony amongst them that God willgrace his presence there. Here in satsang with us, where there areno rules, people sit as they please, they sit comfortably becausehere every one is self-disciplined on their own accord. Theybecome so disciplined that they do not need to have rules in place.Where there are no rules, rules are naturally conformed to.Government makes laws, people make laws, communitiesmake laws and so everyone is caught in the jaws of the laws.There should be no laws in religion. Those who get caught in theweb of laws become trapped by the lawyers (who wear blackrobes). The black robes themselves tell you they are ill-omen.One day the world will do away with laws. No courts!The courts have ruined everything. The black robes (lawyersand courts) have ruined everything. Excessive laws have turnedeverything to poison. Laws have to be reasonable and thereshould never be any laws in religion. So then why do we haveJains and Vaishnavs? How can you call yourself a Jain? Howcan you call yourself a Vaishnav? How can you say you have‘developed’? Laws and rules are necessary for you only if youare foolish. They are not necessary for you, if you are culturedand developed. Jains do not need laws; they can discern all thelaws from within. ‘We’ have allowed people to do whateverthey please without any laws. ‘We’ have given them all thefreedom.A group of us had gone on a 38-day pilgrimage and theretoo, we had no laws. We did not have a rule that no one couldfight or quarrel; everyone was free to fight with whomever theypleased. It was not as if ‘we’ encouraged anyone to fight, butneither did ‘we’ discourage anyone from doing so. If peoplefought, ‘we’ would simply observe them.

He had hurt his leg and could barely walk.When the Chaturmasa was over, he was told, “You now haveto do vihar (leave the ashram).” His leg had not healed so heasked them if he could extend his stay. The head of themonastery told him that under the rules of the ashram, he hadalready spent the maximum time there hence his stay could notbe extended. The old Maharaj had no choice but to leave, sohe said, “Okay, I will go to the village of Chhani; it is four milesaway, I will go there. But I cannot walk four miles, so can youarrange for a doli (a man held carrier made especially fortransporting debilitated people)?” The sanghpati (head of themonastery) tells him, “I do not recall having made sucharrangements for anyone before.” He then consulted his pastrecords and rulebooks but could not find any incident wheresuch services had been provided for a Maharaj. He told theMaharaj, “There is no rule for such a provision, what can I do?How can I break the rules?” Now tell me does everyone havedifficulty in walking that a provision would be made for such arule? Should people not have common sense in dealing withsuch situations or is one to hang on to rules with idioticobstinacy?That poor Maharaj came to me and said to me, “Look atthis uncomfortable situation the sangh (company) has put me in.They keep telling me to leave but no one wants to pay fiftyrupees and arrange for a doli for me. Please help me find away.” ‘We’ then made arrangements to pay for the doli. Thesangh sent off the Maharaj with pomp and grandeur. Theyarranged a flamboyant procession with a band blaring music andthe sanghpati decked in his fancy turban and clothes lead theprocession!They spent 500 hundred rupees for the festivities and theprocession to bid the Maharaj farewell but they could not affordto pay 50 rupees for his doli! If you ask them why, they wouldtell you, “There is a rule that allows for paying for the processionbut none for paying for a doli. Such a rule is not to be foundeven in our history so how can we make provision for it?”Now if this is not called avyavahar (discourtesy,unnatural worldly dealing), then what else can we call it?We do not have any rules here, but at the same time, wecannot break other people’s laws and rules.

You will have to do pratikraman anytimeyou do atikraman.

Even if you have only an idol of God in front of you, youshould do alochana to that idol, making the idol your witnessand make a firm decision not to do the same again.Questioner : How should we take it if someone insultsus?Dadashri : Insult will not bother you if you are Self-realized. If you do not have Gnan, then you have to tell yourselfthat being insulted must be the consequence of your mistakefrom your past life. It must be your fault that the other personinsults you. The other person is avenging the karmic debt(hisaab) from the past life so take it and ‘deposit’ it into yourkarmic account. If you tell the person insulting you, “Sir, insultme again”, he will ask you, “Do I not have anything better todo?” He gives you only that which is coming to you. From thetime you are born till the time you die, everything is compulsory(farajiyat); you are bound for undergoing the experience of allunfolding circumstances in your life. There are many who passtheir ‘exams’ (life’s difficulties) and many who fail. Then thereare those who do not even learn!

This is like eatingfood that is beneficial for you and rejecting food which is not.Similarly, you have to remove artadhyan and raudradhyan anddo dharmadhyan (absence of both forms of adverse meditation).Artadhyan – RaudradhyanQuestioner : What is artadhyan and what is raudradhyan?Dadashri : Any contemplation, even in the slightestdegree, of depriving others of their happiness, is calledraudradhyan. Even if you do not actually carry out the act ofdepriving someone, the mere contemplation of doing so isconsidered raudradhyan. The consequence of raudradhyan is alife in hell (narkagati).Artadhyan is when you experience problems created byothers or internal worries which you keep to yourself, where youtell no one and where you show no anger. Nowadays it is hardto find a person who has just artadhyan alone. Raudradhyan isrampant everywhere. In the current time cycle of Kaliyug,artadhyan and raudradhyan have also infested places of religionand worship. Hence the ascetics constantly experience artadhyanand raudradhyan. Getting upset with a disciple is raudradhyanand experiencing internal irritation and suffering is artadhyan.

These karmic accounts are due to the four differenttypes of dhyan: artadhyan, raudradhyan, dharmadhyan andshukladhyan. Whatever the prevailing dhyan, so are theconsequences.In spite of the wanderings of endless lives, man’sartadhyan and raudradhyan have not stopped. That is why youhave to understand the nature of these adverse meditations.When conflicts arise at home, you have to ask for forgivenessas well as grant forgiveness and you have to do it in such a waythat the other person will not bind any vengeance. The highestdharmadhyan is to remain in the Lord’s Agnas. Why is itnecessary to ask for forgiveness? Are you asking for forgivenesswithout anything in return? No. The truth of the matter is thatwhatever you gave in the past life is exactly what you will getback in this life.Nothing of the outside torments people, it is only theartadhyan and raudradhyan that does so. It is not easy to get ridof anger, pride, illusion and greed (krodha, maan, maya andlobha). How alert and aware do you remain if your doctor tellsyou that you cannot eat any sugar? If your doctor tells you, “Youhave suffered a heart attack and so you must not eat any saltbecause you will suffer another heart attack that will kill you ifyou do.” How attentive do you become in such instances? Whydo you remain so alert there? These artadhyan and raudradhyanperpetuate life after life and that is the death of life after life; theynever liberate you. You will automatically reduce them by fiftypercent from the moment you decide that you want to put a stopto them. You can worship whom ever you want to, read anyscripture you want to, do samayik if you want to, pay homageto any guru you want to, but make sure that no artadhyan orraudradhyan occurs. There can never be shukladhyan (being theSelf) in the current time cycle. Nevertheless if anyone wantsshukladhyan, and wants to stop their worries forever, they cancome here in ‘our’ satsang. ‘We’ will grant him shukladhyanwithin one hour. What can the Gnani Purush not do? He can dowhatever He wishes. ‘We’ (the Gnani Purush and the fullyenlightened Lord within) are not the doer of anything. ‘We’remain constantly in a state (bhaav) of being a nimit (instrumentalevidence).If one cannot achieve shukladhyan, but if he maintainsdharmadhyan in the current era, it is enough. Today, truedharmadhyan has disappeared. People have no understanding atall of what dharmadhyan is. For whatever time one is able to‘do’ or maintain dharmadhyan, even if it is for an hour or two,there is an experience of tremendous happiness at that time.That effect then continues for few more hours. But what cananyone do when people do not even understand whatdharmadhyan is? People are involved in artadhyan andraudradhyan all day long. There is nothing but nagging all daylong. The Lord had said for us to remain in dharmadhyan.Four pillars of dharmadhyanQuestioner : What did the Lord consider dharmadhyan?Dadashri : The Lord has had said that agna is dharma(one’s real religion) and agna is penance also. (Abiding by theLord’s agna is one’s duty and religion and that is true penance).The Lord said there are four pillars of dharmadhyan.The first pillar of dharmadhyan is to accept and believethat Lord’s agnas are correct. This is the first pillar, agna-vichaya. The second pillar is apaya-vichaya where one nolonger has anger, pride, illusion or greed. The third pillar isvipak-vichaya where if someone throws a stone at you, youaccept it as the maturation of your own karma and the fourthpillar is sansthan-vichaya. When one understands the reality ofthese then the dharmadhyan ends completely.Everyone agrees for sure that the Lord’s agnas arecorrect.

Shukladhyanis not to be found in this day and age. So if you want to attaindharmadhyan, get rid of the artadhyan and raudradhyan. Whatis dharmadhyan? It is when you do not see any fault in the onewho slanders, accuses or hurts you. Your Gnan is such that, inspite of his actions against you, you do not see any faults in himand you have the awareness that it is all due to the maturationof your own past karma.

It iswhere your conduct follows the understanding. As long as itdoes not bring about a change in the conduct, we can say thatone has not understood. The effect of understanding mustmanifest in one’s behavior. It must bring about a change in hisconduct.There are two bottles, which look exactly the same. Theyboth have a white liquid in them. One bottle is labeled ‘nectar’and the other is labeled, ‘poison’. You tell a child that he is notto touch the bottles. If the child has seen you take the medicinefrom the ‘nectar’ bottle, he may not know the difference andmay ingest the contents of the bottle labeled ‘poison’. So simplycautioning the child about poison is not enough, you have toexplain in detail what the poison does. You have to explain tohim exactly what poison means and that it kills people. Childrendo not understand the concept of death and so you have toexplain with an example, such as: “Two days ago the man acrossthe road died, do you remember that? The same thing canhappen to you if you drink from this bottle.” The child will nottouch the poison if you explain things in this way with details.Knowledge will come into practice.

Nobody is there to scold you ifyou do not have any mistakes. There will be no superior toscold you when your mistakes are destroyed.

One should remain in dharmadhyan until heattains Gnan (the Self). It is more than enough if you attain onlyAptavani-2135136Aptavani-2dharmadhyan as defined by the Lord. When someone causesyou pain and suffering, or steals from you, if you accept the factthat it is all due to the fruition of your own past karma, thenliberation is yours. Liberation is yours if you do not see othersat fault. But instead people do exactly what they are notsupposed to, they accuse others by saying: ‘He did this to me;he stole from me, etc.’To bite the nimitWhen a mother-in-law makes her miserable, the daughter-in-law does not look at her own faults but keeps blaming themother-in-law and finding faults with her. But if she had anunderstanding of dharmadhyan, she would tell herself, “I am theone at fault. It is because of my own karmas from my past lifethat I have a mother-in-law like this. How come my friend’smother-in-law is so nice?” When other mothers-in-laws are sonice, can she not understand that the fault lies with her? Whyelse would she encounter a mother -in-law such as this one?Questioner : Such problems occur because one has thewrong vision (drashti).Dadashri : No, it is not wrong vision but the fact is thatshe has no awareness (bhan) at all. She does not know thatthese are consequences of her own past karmas. She is onlyseeing what is directly in front of her. She is accusing the nimit;she should not accuse the mother-in-law because the mother-in-law is just a nimit (the instrument, the vehicle through which herkarma is giving the effect). On the contrary, she should thank themother-in-law for releasing her from her karmas. How can youbecome free from your karmas? It is when you do not see themother-in-law, the pickpocket, or someone who imposessuffering upon you as being at fault at all; it is when you do notfault them for their actions but accept and maintain theawareness that you are being released from your own karmathrough them. Otherwise that karma is not over, it has not beendischarged. Here, seeing the mother-in-law at fault the daughter-in-law will bind more karma even before the old ones discharge.This is how people become more entangled as they increasetheir karma, life after life. How can they become free from suchentanglements? There is nothing but entanglements all day long.Animals do not have such entanglements. Only thehumans do and it is because they continue to create new ones.Animals will run away if someone were to hurt them. They donot stay and complain or accuse people that hurt them. They donot have such intellect (buddhi). The humans have attainedintellect (buddhi) and they abuse it. On the contrary theybecome more entangled. People create entanglements in thevery situation they are supposed to become free from. Oneshould become free from every karma. You should become freefrom the entanglement of each of your karma. Every time themother-in-law abuses the daughter-in-law, the daughter-in-lawshould seize the opportunity and become free from karma. Whatshould she do for that? She should not see the mother-in-law asbeing at fault. If she sees her as the nimit and accepts that shehas come to her as a consequence of her past karma, she willbe freed from her karmas. But she will bind even more karmaif she sees her at fault, so what can God or anyone else do?The Lord says, “Even if you bow down to my idoleveryday, until you attain ‘this’ understanding, it is like drinkingpoison and therefore ‘we’ cannot tell you that you will get betterif you keep on drinking. Follow my agnas. Instead ofworshipping me, ‘we’ prefer that you follow ‘our’ agnas. Youworship everyday but you do not abide by a single word of‘ours’ and that is tantamount to stepping on my tongue. Are younot ashamed of that?” One would reply, “Sir, I did not realize thatI was stepping on your tongue.” And that is true. How is the poorman to know that? He does what others do and no one has everexplained things to him. How can he then turn himself around?

Do you think people drink castor oil? Why do they walkaround looking as if they do? The moment one’s internal state(parinati) changes, it shows up on his face; as if he just drankcastor oil! This is because he blames others, although it is hisown fault, and that changes the internal state. Vitarags have saidthat one should look at his own faults. They have said nothingelse. Recognize your own fault and be free. This is the only thingthat will establish You in the abode of liberation. This is all theLord has asked you to do. It involves ‘cash’ (instant)pratikraman. People generally do ‘on credit’ pratikraman oncea year during Paryushan. On the day of the Paryushan, theydress up in fancy clothes; women wear new saris for the annualrecitation of pratikraman. In fact they walk around in a state ofillusion and attachment (murchha). The Lord says that, thatwhich arises out of such illusion is not dharma (religion). If yougrasp the dharma of pratikraman, then it will not matter even ifyou do not have a guru. What do we mean by the dharma ofpratikraman? If you say to this man, “You are a bad person”,then you have to do pratikraman and recognize that you shouldnot have spoken so. You have to invoke the vitarag Lord andrecall the misdeed (alochana): “Dear Lord, I made a mistake. Irepent for speaking in this way (pratikraman) and I vow not todo it again (pratyakhyan).” Avowal to not repeat the mistake iscalled pratyakhyan. If a person does instant alochana,pratikraman and pratyakhyan and not leave anything pending, hewill be a spiritually rich man and go to moksha. It is importantto perform this pratikraman of the Lord instantly, washingtoday’s faults today and tomorrow’s faults tomorrow.

His pratikraman should be, “I must havemade a mistake somewhere that the occasion has arisen for himto insult me.” He has to do pratikraman for his actions of hispast life and you have to do pratikraman for your actions in thislife. A person will indeed attain moksha if he does five hundredor so such pratikramans a day!Such dharmadhyan and pratikraman are not to be foundeven in the upashraya (place where seekers of liberationgather) these days, but what can one do?

Withdharmadhyan you can get rid of the karmas that are alreadybound and not bind any new ones. Moksha is attained only withshukladhyan, which can be attained only from the Gnani Purush.The vitarags have said that there is no shukladhyan in the currentera of this time cycle.

Hard raudradhyanmeans to take advantage of people with lesser intelligence usingone’s higher intelligence. People take advantage of other peopleand hurt them through their intellect; they ‘suck the blood’ outof people leaving them with only ‘skin and bones’ and yet theyclaim to be ahimsak (practicing non-violence towards otherliving beings). They claim ‘Ahimsa is the highest religion.’ Thesesheths have made such ‘arrangements’ that they sit comfortablyon their soft cushions all day while their farmers toil day andnight. The cream of the crop comes to the sheth’s home whilethe workers have barely enough to eat with whatever is left. Thesheths use their higher intellect to take advantage of those withlesser intellect; they kill their workers slowly and gradually, andthat is hard raudradhyan. Instead it would be better if they wereto kill their workers by cutting them in two, at least that way ifthey see blood, they would come to their senses! ‘What have Idone?’ that would be raudradhyan not hard raudradhyan. But inhard raudradhyan, the mind never falters, instead it becomesworse. In hard raudradhyan the sheths suck the blood of theirworkers without shedding a drop. Now how can anyone tacklesomething like this? There is absolutely no end to this. Theconsequences of hard raudradhyan are very grave indeed; noteven the seventh hell is befitting for such hard raudradhyan. So,is it not important to understand hard raudradhyan and updhyanin great details? What do you think? Or do you think it is notnecessary to understand?Questioner : One will have to understand, Dada.Dadashri : The current time cycle is that of the dushamkaal (aka Kaliyug – an era of destruction), 2500 years afterLord Mahavir. So everyone has made mistakes. All ascetics andalike have erred too. With the exception of just a few, allascetics continue to do artadhyan, raudradhyan and updhyanwhole daylong. If you ask them why they became ascetics, theywill say in order to get rid of their artadhyan and raudradhyan.They will tell you it is better to become an ascetic than to liveat home. Rather than face quarrels and conflicts at home orconflicts over money, or worries about getting married andmaking a living, they prefer the life of an ascetic. They believethat by getting rid of such problems, they also rid themselves ofartadhyan and raudradhyan. But today the ascetics have moreartadhyan and raudradhyan than do married people. Everyonewants to abide by the Lords’ agna. Everyone has the earnestdesire to remain within the Lords’ agna, but what can they doif they cannot find the right path?Dhyans that were never present during the time of theLord have arisen in the present time cycle.Here, you will find solution for everything. Since thedeparture of Lord Mahavir, the ‘furnace’ of the worldly life hascontinued to burn for 2500 years. Now the 2500 years havecome to an end and so has the ‘furnace’. A new era is startingnow and everything else is starting anew.Cause of the worldly lifeArtadhyan and raudradhyan are the cause of the worldlylife and that verily is that which perpetuates life after life, theorigin of worldly life (adhikaran kriya). You would not have towander in the worldly life if there was only dharmadhyan andwith dharmadhyan you may someday even attain shukladhyan.With artadhyan and raudradhyan one will create difficulties forothers (kadhapo) and inner turmoil and restlessness (ajampo)the whole daylong. Quarrel is raudradhyan and restlessness isartadhyan. However, if others can see or sense your restlessnessthen it becomes raudradhyan.What is raudradhyan?Do you recognize artadhyan and raudradhyan?Aptavani-2145146Aptavani-2Hard raudradhyanAnother aspect of dhyan is hard raudradhyan which hasalso increased in the current time cycle. Hard raudradhyanmeans to take advantage of people with lesser intelligence usingone’s higher intelligence. People take advantage of other peopleand hurt them through their intellect; they ‘suck the blood’ outof people leaving them with only ‘skin and bones’ and yet theyclaim to be ahimsak (practicing non-violence towards otherliving beings). They claim ‘Ahimsa is the highest religion.’ Thesesheths have made such ‘arrangements’ that they sit comfortablyon their soft cushions all day while their farmers toil day andnight. The cream of the crop comes to the sheth’s home whilethe workers have barely enough to eat with whatever is left. Thesheths use their higher intellect to take advantage of those withlesser intellect; they kill their workers slowly and gradually, andthat is hard raudradhyan. Instead it would be better if they wereto kill their workers by cutting them in two, at least that way ifthey see blood, they would come to their senses! ‘What have Idone?’ that would be raudradhyan not hard raudradhyan. But inhard raudradhyan, the mind never falters, instead it becomesworse. In hard raudradhyan the sheths suck the blood of theirworkers without shedding a drop.

Quarrel is raudradhyan and restlessness isartadhyan. However, if others can see or sense your restlessnessthen it becomes raudradhyan.What is raudradhyan?Do you recognize artadhyan and raudradhyan?Aptavani-2147148Aptavani-2Usually anger is directed towards others, is it not?Generally people get angry with other people; however angerthat is directed towards one’s self is called artadhyan by theLord. People are no fools; they get angry with others but notthemselves. Are there people who get angry with themselves?Do they not get angry with others? Getting angry with someoneis same as having intent (bhaav) to hurt that person. Anger isconsidered intent to hurt. Greed (lobha) is intent of deprivingothers. Deceit (kapat) and illusion (maya) is intent of deprivingothers by harming them. Pride (maan) is the intent ofdisrespecting, rejecting others and considering them inferior. Allthe four passions, anger, pride, deceit and greed are raudradhyanbecause they hurt others.What is artadhyan ?Do you have some guests you like and some you do not?When people you don’t like come to your home, you think,“Why did they have to come?” You are overcome with dreadthe moment they enter your home, and yet you have to say,“Come on in. Have a seat”, don’t you? You have to say that inorder to maintain your reputation in the community. On theoutside you invite them into your home but from within you aredreading their stay. The Lord calls this artadhyan. Artadhyan isthe dhyan that makes only you suffer. Now typically when guestscome, they don’t leave right away, do they? So welcome themand remember that the Lord has said not to let artadhyan occurand if it does, then do pratikraman. Ask the Lord for forgiveness:‘Lord, why does artadhyan occur? I do not want to do so.’When people you like come to stay with you, you feelgood but that too is artadhyan. And at the time of theirdeparture, when you feel sad and wish they did not have toleave, that too is artadhyan. If you get angry with someone, it israudradhyan, but if you repent afterwards, it is converted intoartadhyan.There are people who justify their anger by saying, “Itwas necessary to get angry.” Defending your anger is doublingthe raudradhyan! Raudradhyan occurs when you get angry andby defending and supporting your anger, you double theraudradhyan. If you feel remorse after getting angry, yourrepentance reduces raudradhyan to artadhyan.A bhaav (inner intent) of making money is raudradhyanbecause it is the intent of taking money away from others.Therefore, the Lord has said, “Do not have intent for makingmoney at all.” What one gets in this life is correct.Dadashri : Do you have to do dhyan in order to take abath everyday?Questioner : No Sir.Dadashri : You still get water for your bath, even whenyou don’t do dhyan for it, correct?Questioner : That is correct.Dadashri : Just as you get water for your bath it is a rulethat each person will get money necessary for him or her.

If this diseaseof chasing money is caused by worldly influence, then whichAptavani-2149150Aptavani-2influence (sangnya) can cure it? The Lord has said that Gnani’sinfluence will cure this disease. Disease caused by influence ofthe world will be cured by the influence of the Gnani.The point ‘we’ are making is that you get water for yourbath, a mattress to sleep on and so many other such necessitieseven without you worrying or thinking about them, so in thesame token money will come to you if you remain natural andspontaneous (sahaj).How do you think ‘we’ Gnanis analyze everything? Noone has a clue as to how the world functions and runs. A youngman will start to worry whether his own beard will grow whenhis friend’s does not. In reality this world is such that there is noneed for a person to have any doubts or worries about anything.It is a different matter if someone else has a problem, but youare going to be fine for sure. It is a different matter if someoneelse’s beard does not grow, but yours will without a doubt.Every man will grow a beard; it is rare to see a man not growbeard.If you ask someone, “Are you going to make money?” hewill tell you, “I am certain I will make money and I will lose ittoo.” Neither making money nor losing is under anyone’s controlso why become preoccupied with it? Why should you ruin yourdhyan over it? Money will continue to come and go. It is allunder nature’s control. Therefore, if you earn one lakh rupees itis under nature’s control or if your lose it; it is also under nature’scontrol. If it is not under your control, why meddle in it?Whatever one does as ‘I am Chandulal’ (aropit bhaav),he creates bondage and binds karma and until then artadhyanand raudradhyan will not cease. The essence of the Jain religionis to stop artadhyan and raudradhyan. What is the point whenpeople of other religions experience artadhyan and raudradhyanand you as a Jain, do too? Is there not a difference between Jainreligion and other religions? If there are four dhyans in otherreligions and four dhyans in Jain religion too, then how can wecall it the religion of the vitarag Lords? Aside of these fourdhyans, there is not a fifth type of dhyan. Should there not besomething extra and special in the religion of the vitarags? Aperson may ask what this extra thing is and the answer is howmany durdhyans have been eliminated? Of the four dhyans,which have you reduced? The Lord will let go if yourraudradhyan has stopped and artadhyan still remains. One issaid to have attained the vitarag dharma when there is a slightdecrease in both artadhyan and raudradhyan.Questioner : What kind of dhyan is it to think about thefuture?Dadashri : That falls under artadhyan. A thought of thepast that causes problems is artadhyan. If a person thinks abouthis son who died over a year ago and cries, is artadhyan. Aperson does artadhyan and raudradhyan during his suffering.Excessive grieving over the loss of an only son will cause one towander until the end of a kalp. One will have to wander ahundred million (one crore) years.‘We’ ask the cloth merchants who cheat their customers,“Do you not wish to attain moksha?” They wonder why ‘we’ask such a question. So ‘we’ have to tell them, “What dhyan areyou doing when you are cutting the cloth short?” At leastunderstand Lord Mahavir’s words about dhyan. What you aredoing is raudradhyan. Depriving others, even in the slightest, israudradhyan. If your customer asks, “What is the price of thisterylene cloth?” You may quote him eighteen and a half insteadof eighteen, if you want to. Having said so, you have to give thefull length. In other words, charge them more but do not givethem less material than what they pay for. And even if you don’tgive them less, even the mere intent of doing so is raudradhyanalso.

Insteadpeople believe, “I am the doer. Who will do it if I am no longeraround?” Such bhaav and belief binds karmas; they bind heavy(nikachit) karma, consequences of which one will have to sufferseverely. They are not mild karmas.No one is to blame here. The acharyas, sadhus etc. allwant to do what the Lord has told them to do but they do notcome across appropriate circumstances.

This is the path of AkramVignan and so all external activities are like those of the worldlyAptavani-2153154Aptavani-2(mithyatvi) people, yet their dhyan (inner state) changescompletely.The Lord has said that no conflicts prevail in dharmadhyan.Money may increase or decrease, but one should be free ofconflicts. It is hard to find a home where there are no conflicts.Differences of opinions are considered conflicts and where thereis conflict there is the worldly life. He, whose conflicts aredestroyed, is considered to have come into the state ofGodhood.Conflicts start out small and then turn into major ones.Conflicts and differences of opinion really waste the human lifeaway; a life that is earned with great difficulty. Whatever amountof time one spends in conflicts is the amount of time one bindsfor a life in the animal kingdom. A person of virtue will not binda life in the animal kingdom.Bhagwan is the one without clashQuestioner : What if someone clashes with us evenwhen we do not want to?Dadashri : Yes, that is how the world is. That is why‘we’ tell you to find yourself such a ‘cave’ that no one knowsabout and no one can find. Otherwise, people will track youdown no matter where you are and clash with you. In the end,even the mosquitoes will come in the night and trouble you. Theywill not leave you in peace. Having attained this human life, ifyou do not want to regress into a lower life form (adhogati),then do not allow clashes to occur with anyone. Once youdestroy your own clashes and help others do the same, you willattain a status where people will look upon you with reverence(lokpujya).The atma (soul, the Self), itself is parmatma (fullyenlightens Self), hence it is lokpujya (worthy of reverence byall), but even the pudgal (the relative self; the physicalmanifestation) is also worthy of reverence, provided one losesall traces of inner clash (kashaya, arta or raudradhyan). Whenone no longer has any inner clash, and when others do not inciteany clash within him, then that relative-self too becomes worthyof worship. It is fine if all other bhaav remain but clash (kalushitbhaav) should not arise. When you do not have any clash withinor towards anyone else, you become worthy of worship. Whatdid ‘we’ discover within us? What was within ’us’ that left?Why is this body revered (lokpujya) by others? It is because‘we’ constantly remain in the Self, but also all traces of conflicts(kashays) have vanished from this body. That is why this bodyis revered. Only the inner clash (kalushit bhaav) has vanished butotherwise this body enjoys eating, drinking and even wearinggood clothes and yet it is worthy of worship and respect. Thatis the wonder of this time cycle, is it not? This is the eleventhwonder called asanyati puja, worship of a householder.This path of Akram Vignan is such that it is possible to getrid of all tendencies towards conflict. Not only will conflictvanish within you, but because of you, others too will not haveconflicts. The one who comes seeking conflict will be pacifiedbecause you are without any clash. The entire inner intent of theother person will change. This ‘house’ (the physical body) isnever with conflict but it appears that way because of your owntendencies to clash (kashays, kalushit bhaav). Then you will sayyou do not like this ‘room.’ Once you project your own clashingtendencies (kalushit bhaav) into anything, it becomes tainted andspoilt.This world is such that one’s relative self can be worthyof worship if his tendency towards clash (kalushit bhaav) goesaway. Then it does not matter whether he is a Muslim, Jain orVaishnav. An oliya (Muslim priest) becomes worthy of worshipand respect because these clash tendencies have decreasedsignificantly. Nevertheless that is a natural trait within him, whichhe attains on his path of progression and development.Aptavani-2153154Aptavani-2(mithyatvi) people, yet their dhyan (inner state) changescompletely.The Lord has said that no conflicts prevail in dharmadhyan.Money may increase or decrease, but one should be free ofconflicts. It is hard to find a home where there are no conflicts.Differences of opinions are considered conflicts and where thereis conflict there is the worldly life. He, whose conflicts aredestroyed, is considered to have come into the state ofGodhood.Conflicts start out small and then turn into major ones.Conflicts and differences of opinion really waste the human lifeaway; a life that is earned with great difficulty. Whatever amountof time one spends in conflicts is the amount of time one bindsfor a life in the animal kingdom. A person of virtue will not binda life in the animal kingdom.Bhagwan is the one without clashQuestioner : What if someone clashes with us evenwhen we do not want to?Dadashri : Yes, that is how the world is. That is why‘we’ tell you to find yourself such a ‘cave’ that no one knowsabout and no one can find. Otherwise, people will track youdown no matter where you are and clash with you. In the end,even the mosquitoes will come in the night and trouble you. Theywill not leave you in peace. Having attained this human life, ifyou do not want to regress into a lower life form (adhogati),then do not allow clashes to occur with anyone. Once youdestroy your own clashes and help others do the same, you willattain a status where people will look upon you with reverence(lokpujya).The atma (soul, the Self), itself is parmatma (fullyenlightens Self), hence it is lokpujya (worthy of reverence byall), but even the pudgal (the relative self; the physicalmanifestation) is also worthy of reverence, provided one losesall traces of inner clash (kashaya, arta or raudradhyan). Whenone no longer has any inner clash, and when others do not inciteany clash within him, then that relative-self too becomes worthyof worship. It is fine if all other bhaav remain but clash (kalushitbhaav) should not arise. When you do not have any clash withinor towards anyone else, you become worthy of worship. Whatdid ‘we’ discover within us? What was within ’us’ that left?Why is this body revered (lokpujya) by others? It is because‘we’ constantly remain in the Self, but also all traces of conflicts(kashays) have vanished from this body. That is why this bodyis revered. Only the inner clash (kalushit bhaav) has vanished butotherwise this body enjoys eating, drinking and even wearinggood clothes and yet it is worthy of worship and respect. Thatis the wonder of this time cycle, is it not? This is the eleventhwonder called asanyati puja, worship of a householder.This path of Akram Vignan is such that it is possible to getrid of all tendencies towards conflict. Not only will conflictvanish within you, but because of you, others too will not haveconflicts. The one who comes seeking conflict will be pacifiedbecause you are without any clash. The entire inner intent of theother person will change. This ‘house’ (the physical body) isnever with conflict but it appears that way because of your owntendencies to clash (kashays, kalushit bhaav). Then you will sayyou do not like this ‘room.’ Once you project your own clashingtendencies (kalushit bhaav) into anything, it becomes tainted andspoilt.This world is such that one’s relative self can be worthyof worship if his tendency towards clash (kalushit bhaav) goesaway. Then it does not matter whether he is a Muslim, Jain orVaishnav. An oliya (Muslim priest) becomes worthy of worshipand respect because these clash tendencies have decreasedsignificantly. Nevertheless that is a natural trait within him, whichhe attains on his path of progression and development.Aptavani-2155156Aptavani-2However, there is no purusharth (real inner effort) on his part.Purusharth begins only after one attains the Self. After Gnan onecomes to the state of the Self and then all clash and conflictbegin to leave. Otherwise, when you get rid of one inner conflict(kashaya), four more take its place. If you do not guard againstthis, their whole army will move in. When are you able to guardagainst them? It is when you become the Self. An entire armythat causes clash is present within you. If you do not have a‘security guard’, all the ‘thieves’ will take over within.If clash within (kalushit bhaav) does not decrease day byday, beastliness will prevail, not humanity.What is the definition of worthiness of worldly worshipand reverence (lokpujya)? In this era of the current time cycle,a status which people do not condemn (loknindya), the Lordcalls this worthy of worship (lokpujya). The Lord was very wiseabout this, His disciples however are not; they do not have theawareness that they should not let anything tarnish their praiseworthy status which the Lord has thus defined. Otherwisepersons truly worthy of worship and reverence are very rare;there may be hardly two or three in the whole world. Thedisciples today worship and respect their gurus the way they doa policeman. They talk behind the guru’s back and say their guruis not even worth talking about! Krupaludev, Shrimad Rajchandrawas truly worthy of worship by the world (lokpujya). Lokpujyastatus (gotra) is the highest of all status. The Lord was lokpujya.Ask for forgiveness and cleanse away whatever traits you havethat beget criticism (loknindya).What is the definition of God? It is people around himwith similar viewpoint as his, who see only him as God. Peoplewith similar viewpoint as Jesus will see Jesus as God; if we wereto show them Lord Mahavir; they would not accept Mahavir asGod.Even a ‘Gnani Purush’ is accepted as God by people.The term God (Bhagwan) is an adjective. And ‘we’ areShuddhatma without adjectives. The world has come aboutbecause of adjectives. Shuddhatma does not have any adjectiveand that is why ‘our’ state is devoid of any adjectives(nirvishesh).To call ‘us’ God (Bhagwan), it is equivalent to making funof the Gnani Purush. You too can be called a Bhagwan (God),if you do not have any clash tendency (kalushit bhaav) towardsanyone, nor do you incite it in any one else. People call ‘us’Bhagwan (God) too but ‘our’ state is beyond all adjectives; itis a state without any attributes or adjectives. This state is notto be found in scriptures; therefore no one should delve intousing adjectives. ‘We’ do not have any adjectives. Bhagwan isan adjective, it is not a noun. When a person becomes a B.Sc.he is called a graduate. Then if he studies for another ten years,it is belittling to then call him a graduate. To call a Gnani PurushBhagwan, is the same as putting Him down to a lower level.Gnani Purush is a wonder. He is without any adjectives. Buthow are people to understand that? That is why they call Him,Bhagwan. The word Bhagwan comes from the root word‘bhag’. Just like the word ‘bhagyavan’ meaning fortunate fromthe word ‘bhagya’ (fortune), the word Bhagwan comes from‘bhagwat’ meaning God like quality. Therefore the one whopossesses God like qualities is called Bhagwan. The GnaniPurush has gone way beyond that. There is nothing else left forthe Gnani to attain. There is nothing beyond that. ‘We’ lack onlyfour degrees from attaining the Absolute state of Omniscience(keval Gnan). Lord Mahavir had completed 360° (perfectknowledge) and ‘our’ Gnan stopped at 356° and that toobecause of the peculiarity of the current era of this time cycle.But if you wish, ‘we’ can bestow that keval Gnan of 360° withinan hour to you. You have to be ready for it. However becauseof the strangeness and peculiarity of this era of this time cycle,you will not be able to digest it completely.

But one does notdestroy the mistakes in this life and continues to increase them.In order to destroy a mistake one has to first recognize andaccept that it is a mistake. Moreover, he cannot protect it. Thisis the Gnani’s key that can open all the locks (solve allproblems).We are bound by our own mistakes. If the mistakes aredestroyed, then one is parmatma (Supreme Self). He who hasno mistakes is a parmatma. What does a mistake tell you? ‘Youneed to know me and recognize me.’ Ordinarily people think oftheir mistake as a positive attribute and this leads to the mistakeruling over you. But if you recognize it as a mistake, it will runaway from you. Instead, people fail to recognize their mistakesand on the contrary, they protect them, so they feed theirmistakes.Protecting mistakesQuestioner : Dada, how does one protect a mistake?Dadashri : If you scold someone and then say, “Heneeds to be scolded, he would not understand otherwise”, themistake will realize that you have not recognized it and on thecontrary, you are protecting it, so it will remain where it is andenjoy the ‘food’ you give it. Protecting your mistakes just oncewill extend their life by ten more years. You should not protectany of your mistakes.There is no stubbornness in ‘us’. If someone were toshow us ‘our’ mistake, ‘we’ would accept it immediately. ‘We’would tell him, “Yes sir, ‘we’ thank you for showing ‘us’ ourmistake.” You should be thankful to the other person that hepointed out your mistake, which you could not see yourself.Tremendous energies can arise within you, if you can realizetwenty-five or so mistakes everyday. In order for you torecognize mistakes, ‘we’ have given you the sutra: ‘fault is ofthe sufferer.’ If there is any suffering on your part, the mistakeis yours for sure. If someone robs you and you curse the personwho robbed you, your mistake gets an extension. That mistakewill realize that you are feeding it and so it will not leave. Ifsomeone burns your home down, you curse that person. Butwho is the one suffering? The fault is of the one suffering, theperson who torched your home is sitting peacefully in his ownhome.If someone writes ‘Dada is a thief’ on my back, then thefault is mine, because who has time to waste writing such things?And why did they write this only on my back? So, ‘we’ wouldimmediately accept it and settle the matter. It is because youhave not settled your mistakes in the past life that the samemistakes keep coming over and over. You do not know how tosettle your mistakes and so you make five more in the processof getting rid of one mistake.The worldly life does not hinder you. Eating and drinkingdoes not hinder you.

That iswhy they remain ever fortified.The biggest mistake of all is swachhand; to act accordingto one’s own intellect and ego. An entire army of mistakes hasarisen because of swachhand. The moment one makes astatement, ‘So, what is wrong in what I am doing?’ he isfinished! He ruins endless lives thereafter.With the grace and energy that the Gnani Purush bestowsupon you, you will be able to see your mistakes and destroythem. ‘We’ tell anyone who wants to be free of mistakes, tostop protecting and feeding their anger, pride, deceit (illusion)and greed for the duration of only three years. Thereaftermistakes will die. The definition of a mistake is the protection ofanger, pride, deceit (illusion) and greed. If mistakes are deprivedof the ‘food’ of support and not given any protection for threeyears, they will leave you and go somewhere else.Prakruti of a greedy personWhen a greedy person goes to the market he goes to theplace where cheaper vegetables are stacked. The greed withinhim says, “This greedy man feeds me readily, so why not takerefuge here?” Therefore in order to destroy his greed, thegreedy person should go where the vegetables are expensiveand buy them without asking the price. He should buy them evenif he has to pay double the price. The greed within him willhere would recognize. ‘We’ too would know that a mistakeoccurred. The subtle mistakes can also be recognized throughthe intellect (buddhi). The subtler and subtlest mistakes can onlybe identified in advanced stages of Gnan. Human beings cannotsee these subtler and subtlest mistakes. The celestial beings cansee them if they look through knowledge beyond the senses(avadhi). However, these mistakes do not harm anyone. Thesemistakes still remain within me (Gnani) and that too because ofthe peculiarity of this current time cycle.Blunders and mistakesThere are endless mistakes, not just one. One is bound byhis blunders and mistakes. The mistakes will not go away unlesshis blunders are destroyed.Questioner : What are blunders?Dadashri : ‘I am Chandulal’ is the blunder. After ‘we’give you the knowledge of the Self, your blunder will bedestroyed and only your mistakes will remain. You will see thosemistakes as gneya (that to be known). You become free fromwhatever gneya you ‘see’ as gneya. Mistakes have layers justlike the layers of an onion. As you see a mistake, that layer ofthe mistake is discarded. When all the layers are shed, thatparticular mistake will be destroyed from its roots forever. Somemistakes have only one layer and no more, and so ‘You’ onlyhave to ‘see’ them once and they will be destroyed. You haveto repeatedly see the ones with more layers and do pratikramanin order to get rid of them completely. Then there are somemistakes that are so sticky that they require repeated pratikraman.People may ask if you keep making the same mistake over andover and you will say yes, but you do not understand the reasonbehind this. Mistakes are in a form of layers; these layers can beendless. Therefore, if you do pratikraman for them whatevermistakes that become visible, will be purified.

After ‘we’give you the knowledge of the Self, your blunder will bedestroyed and only your mistakes will remain. You will see thosemistakes as gneya (that to be known). You become free fromwhatever gneya you ‘see’ as gneya. Mistakes have layers justlike the layers of an onion. As you see a mistake, that layer ofthe mistake is discarded. When all the layers are shed, thatparticular mistake will be destroyed from its roots forever. Somemistakes have only one layer and no more, and so ‘You’ onlyhave to ‘see’ them once and they will be destroyed. You haveto repeatedly see the ones with more layers and do pratikramanin order to get rid of them completely. Then there are somemistakes that are so sticky that they require repeated pratikraman.People may ask if you keep making the same mistake over andover and you will say yes, but you do not understand the reasonbehind this. Mistakes are in a form of layers; these layers can beendless. Therefore, if you do pratikraman for them whatevermistakes that become visible, will be purified. Krupaludev hassaid:Aptavani-2163164Aptavani-2realize that it is not going to get any food and so it will leave.A man used to visit me at my home. He was a managersomewhere and had a good salary. He was married but he hadno children. One day he tells me, “Dada I am very tight fisted.I cannot let go of money. If I am asked to serve food atsomeone’s wedding, I serve very little. People comment loudenough for me to hear, ‘This man is so stingy’. My wife toocomplains about it. But what can I do? I cannot get rid of thisgreedy nature. Please show me a way out. This greed makes melook ugly even when I am asked to give at someone else’s cost.”So ‘we’ told him, “When you come to satsang every day, do notwalk but take a rickshaw and on your way here, get ten rupeesworth of loose change and drop it along the way.” He did what‘we’ told him and he succeeded. Doing this stops greed frombeing fed and the mind becomes broad.Your acceptance of your mistakes destroys themOnce you start to recognize your mistakes, those mistakeswill be destroyed. There are some cloth merchants who stretchthe fabric while measuring it and boast that they shortchangedtheir customers by quarter of a yard. This is tremendousraudradhyan and what is more they are protecting it. A mistakeshould not be protected. When a vendor deceptively adulterateshis ghee (clarified butter) and makes 500 Rupees on the side,he is planting a whole tree instead of a seed which will ruin hisendless lives to come.Questioner : But Dada I can only see a few of my faultsand mistakes, I cannot see more.Dadashri : By sitting here in the satsang, many veils ofignorance are shed and the more they are shed, the moremistakes you will see.Awareness of seeing faultsQuestioner : How can the awareness to see more faultsbe attained?Dadashri : There is a lot of awareness within you but theintent (bhavna) to see your faults has not arisen. When apoliceman has an intention of looking for robbers, he will findthem. But if he says, “There is no need to look for robbers, Iwill arrest them when they come”, would the robbers not havefun? These mistakes lie hidden. They can be easily found if youlook for them.What is the benefit for all your earnings? If you are ableto see your own faults, then you have truly earned something.You can say that you have earned something only when you areable to see your faults, one after another. This satsang is for youto be able to see all your faults. And those faults will leave onlywhen you see them. When will you be able to see your ownfaults? It is when you become the Soul, Self-realized. The onewho can see his own fault is great and advanced spiritually.When You become completely impartial towards your body,speech and conduct, then will you be able to see all your faults.In the Kramic path a person can never see his own faults.If you tell me, “I have many faults but I can only see a few”, then‘we’ would believe that you are worthy of moksha. But the onewho says, “I see only a few faults within me”, that person hasinfinite faults and yet he claims he has only a few! Just becauseyou see only a few, does that mean you should believe you haveonly a few?When can you say that you have attained the path of LordMahavir? When you are able to see hundreds of your faultseveryday and when you do hundreds of pratikraman everyday,then you can say you are on the path of Lord Mahavir. SwaroopGnan or knowledge of the Self is way beyond this stage, butpeople walk around intoxicated with the belief that they haveattained it after reading just a few books of the scriptures.

SwaroopGnan or knowledge of the Self is way beyond this stage, butpeople walk around intoxicated with the belief that they haveattained it after reading just a few books of the scriptures. Theyhave not attained even a drop of the Self! Where Gnan stops,Aptavani-2165166Aptavani-2intoxication (keyf) increases. As one’s intoxication of ‘I knowsomething’ increases, elimination of the veils of ignorancecovering vision (darshan-avaran) comes to a halt and so doesthe elimination of knowledge covering veils (gnan-avaran).Nothing except your obstinacy hinders your progress towardsmoksha. The greatest areas of danger (bhaisthan) you shouldfear is swachhand (to act according to your own wishes) and theintoxication of ‘I know something’.If the sadhu maharajs (spiritual preceptors) stop just theone mistake of reveling in pride of doer ship as their karmaunfolds (garva of udaya karma), then their work is done. You donot have to look at their external conduct, it is acceptable evenif they have kashays (anger, pride, attachment and greed) butthey must not relish this sense of doer-ship (garva ras). That isall one has to look for in a maharaj (Jain spiritual master).Anyone who destroys even one mistake of his own isworthy of being called God. You will find many who will showyou your mistakes but they are not able to destroy them for you.What is more, they must know how to show you your mistakes,if one does not know how, then he should admit that he is theone with mistakes. It is a task of tremendous responsibility toshow someone his mistakes. The one who destroys mistakes inothers is God. Only a Gnani Purush can do that. ‘We’ do notsee anyone accountable or guilty in this world. Whether it is apickpocket or someone with degraded conduct; ‘we’ see themboth as faultless. That is why a Gnani can destroy your mistakes.No one else is capable of doing so. God has never consideredworldly faults as a fault. ‘Ignorance of the Self’ is the greatestfault. As long as the fault of ‘I am Chandulal’ exists, all otherfaults exist. Once you attain the knowledge of the Self, then allother faults will leave.Impartial visionOne cannot see one’s own faults without the knowledgeof the Self. In the absence of real knowledge there prevails thebelief, ‘I am Chandulal, I do not have any faults and I am a verynice man.’ After Gnan one becomes impartial. After Gnan oneis not partial to the mind, body and speech and that is why hecan see his own mistakes. The one who can find his mistakes,the one who can see his mistakes at every moment, who seesthe mistakes whenever they occur, has become parmatma. Hehas become Lord Mahavir! After attaining ‘our’ Gnan, youbecome impartial because you realize that you are not Chandulalbut a pure Soul. Your spiritual work is done when you begin tosee all your faults but none in others. Previously the feeling of ‘Iam Chandulal’ used to prevail and therefore you could not beimpartial. Now that you have become impartial, you will beginto see all your own faults. You do not see faults in othersbecause your awareness is towards the relative self. When youbegin to see your own faults, it means that the Gnan ‘we’ havegiven you is beginning to produce results. When you see faultsin yourself, it means you do not see faults in others. To see faultsin others is a terrible fault in itself. How can you see faults inothers when no one is at fault in this flawless world? The ego isat fault, and until the ego is cleansed, the faults will remain. Aslong as the faults remain, the ego remains. You have tocontinuously destroy your faults until the ego is completelydestroyed.Faults can be destroyed through pratikraman. You beginto see your faults when conflict arises, those faults will remainconcealed and latent if conflicts do not occur. When you beginto see up to five hundred or so of your faults per day, thenrealize that omniscience is approaching. After Gnan, ‘we’ couldsee thousands of faults daily. As you begin to see the faults, theydecrease and as the faults decrease, the awareness of the Selfincreases. Now, only subtlest (sookshmatam) and subtler(sookshmatar) faults remain within, which ‘we’ see and know.These faults do not hinder anyone.

But to you ‘we’ give only keval Gnan of 360°within an hour but you will not be able to digest it all. Alas! ‘we’ourselves could not digest it by four degrees. Because of thecurrent era of this time cycle, it fell short by four degrees! Withinthere is knowledge of 360° and on the relative plane it is stuckat 356°. In this time cycle, it is not possible for the relative-selfto reach the complete 360°. But ‘we’ do not have any problemswith that because ‘we’ experience endless bliss within. There is no superior over you, ‘we’ assure you of this.Only your mistakes are your superior. If you meet a Gnani, thenHe can destroy your mistakes. You are bound by your ownmistakes. You believe you are making the effort for liberationthrough whatever sadhan (tool, scripture or worldly guru) youuse but these very instruments bind (merit karma) you.Had you destroyed one mistake per one previous life, youwould have been in a state of moksha, but in trying to destroyone mistake, one ends up creating five more. Externally oneappears wonderful and calm but internally there is nothing butturmoil. How can you call this having destroyed your mistakes?There is no superior above you but you need someone to showyou your mistakes. How can one find his mistakes through hisown efforts? And there are not just one or two mistakes. Thereare endless mistakes. There are endless mistakes of the bodyand endless mistakes of speech. Mistakes of speech are veryharmful. Sometimes people invite their friends for dinner but theyuse such harsh speech that despite a delicious meal of thirty-twovarieties, there will be no joy in it. The guests feel it would havebeen better had they not been invited. Even when they servesimple tea, their speech is so abrasive. And there are countlessenemies in the mind.Who is able to destroy your mistakes? The Gnani Purush,the one who has destroyed his every mistake within; the onewho despite having a body has no sense of ownership of thatbody (ashariri bhaav) and is a vitarag, free from all attachments.The seed of Gnan means freedom from the sense of, ‘I am thisbody.’ Upon destroying all the mistakes, the seed of ignoranceof the Self is destroyed and the seed of Gnan will developcompletely; that verily is freedom from ‘I am this body.’ If thereis slightest attachment towards the body, then it is notconsidered, ‘I am not this body’ (ashariri bhaav). And attachment(mamata, mamatva) will not go as long as there is ignorance.Foundation of mistakesQuestioner : Dada, Why do we see faults in others?Dadashri : You see faults in others because of your ownmistakes. Dada sees everyone as faultless because He hasdestroyed all his mistakes. The ego within shows you mistakesin others. The one, who wants to see all his mistakes, will beable to do so. The one who wants to attain the flawless vision,i.e. a vision that sees no faults in others, will indeed see no faultsin others.The one who makes the mistakes is the one who has todeal with and destroy it, deal with it. Why should you meddlein other people’s mistakes?Questioner : Dada, I inadvertently see faults in otherseven when I do not want to. What can I do about these ‘ghosts’that possess me?Dadashri : It is the intellect (buddhi) that confuses youso. It is the deluded intellect and it has been with you from manypast lives. What is more, it does not leave because it hassupport. If you understand that this intellect is of no benefit toyou, then you will become free of it. If you tell your servant youno longer need his services but then ask him to run errands foryou, is it acceptable?

Viparit buddhi i.e. deluded intellect shows youworldly benefits and non-benefits, whereas samyak buddhi i.e.enlightened intellect will push away the worldly life and take youtowards moksha.Questioner : What should I do if I cannot get rid of myfaults?Dadashri : Faults will not go away but if you say they arenot yours then you become free from them.Questioner : But what if they still do not go away after‘saying’ that?Dadashri : How can faults that have become as solid asice, leave right away? Nevertheless, if you maintain a relationshipof ‘they are to be known and I am the Knower (gneya-gnata)’with them, they will leave. You are the gnata, the Knower andthe faults are gneya, that to be known. The faults should not getany support from you. If they do not get any support, they willfall away without fail. This world exists because of the supportof ignorance of the Self and it will cease to do so once thatsupport is removed. But people do not know how to removethat support. Only the Gnani knows how; it is a task for only aGnani. This world is full of infinite mysteries so how is one tounderstand its most mysterious mystery?One who complains is the guilty oneWho complains first? In Kaliyug the one who complainsfirst is the guilty one and in Satyug (age of unity in thoughts,speech and actions) the person who is correct is the first one tocomplain. In Kaliyug, those dispensing justice are such that theyside with the one they hear first.As soon as her father comes home from work, the littlegirl complains to him about her brother, “Daddy, he did this tome, he did that to me.” The father immediately sides with thedaughter. He summons the brother and scolds him, “Why didyou do that to her?” Arey! Should you not at least ask the sonwhat happened before you scold him? Should you not questionwhy the daughter complained and not the son? What did the sonreally do? He accepts the daughter’s version to be true becausehe is sensitive himself. Then the father claims, “I have weak ears(easily misled), which is why I made a mistake.” He is the foolishone but he blames the ears for his mistake! He does not realizethat his daughter is at fault, which is why she is the first one tocomplain. At home, if anyone came complaining, ‘we’ wouldfirst listen to everyone’s side of the story and then make ajudgment. If justice is dispensed correctly, the guilty party willnot proceed further; he will realize that you are fair and judiciousand that he will be exposed.For us there is no need to explain anything to anyone inthis world. Only the guilty one has to give clarifications andexplanations. Everyone wants to be an arbitrator (interfere withuseless judgment) in this world. ‘We’ do not let any arbitratorintervene; they cannot change anything. Mud says, ‘Stick yourhands in if you wish, but you will have to wash them.’ You haveto look after your own affair. Why should we give anyone theopportunity to become our arbitrator?People spend entire day preoccupied with ‘mine’ and‘yours’! And they take nothing with them when they die. Whatdo you take with you to your next life? You take yourentanglements and quarrels that you have had with others. Youtake whatever charities you have done. And you have to takethe ego with you for sure. The ego, who is the owner of all theentanglements, is going to remain with you for sure. Anger,pride, illusion, greed and ego will all go with you.Consequences of instigationQuestioner : Can a person be punished for someoneelse’s fault?Aptavani-2169170Aptavani-2buddhi run even a single errand for you.

Youencounter a nimit (person who is instrumental) because of yourown faults. The one who suffers is verily the one at fault. Thereare consequences in doing something yourself, in making othersdo or encouraging others into doing. You will have to face theconsequences for encouraging and instigating (anumodan)others into doing. Without an action (cause) there can be noreaction (effect).Questioner : What does anumodan mean?Dadashri : If a person is hesitant about doing somethingand you tell him, “Go ahead and do it. I am here with you.” Thatis called anumodan (to give encouragement) and the one whoencourages, carries a greater liability. Who faces a greaterliability for doing something? The consequences are distributedheavily upon the one who uses more intellect. People findmistakes in others but none in themselves. If the mind runscontrary to one’s wishes, he will say he is fed up of this world.If the intellect interferes, he will say that the intellect is beingobstinate. There is endless Ramayana and Mahabharata (wars)within one and he becomes the owner.Who is the owner of the universe ?Every jiva (embodied soul) is the owner of this universe.But one lives like an insect (jivadu) because of ignorance of theSelf. He who has no ownership of the body becomes the ownerof the entire universe. Realization that you are the owner of thewhole world is moksha in itself. Why then are you still not ableto understand this? It is because your mistakes still bind you;otherwise the whole world belongs to you. When someoneinsults you, he does so because there must be an outstandingkarmic account pending with him, so you should accept it andcredit it in your account. Who would start a new business ofcreating new karmas again? If you deposit that insult into youraccount, that particular karma will end and thereafter you willsee good ones.If you press your eyelid with your finger, you will see twoobjects instead of one. The eyes are not the soul; they are partof the relative self. Nevertheless, even with just one mistake, yousee two instead of one, do you not? If a few pieces of glasswere lying on the ground, you will see many eyes reflected inthem, will you not? With just a slight error on the part of theeyes, you see so many eyes, do you not? Similarly, the soul itselfis not affected, but due to the pressure of surroundingcircumstances, you see infinite forms instead of one. The basicnature of all living beings is godly. A mere thought of choppingdown a tree binds karma. Negative thoughts about other livingbeings bind demerit karma (paap) and positive thoughts bindmerit karma (punya). Even negative thoughts that come to yourmind, is a fault on your part. When you come to satsang and seea lot of people standing around and you think, “What are theystanding around here for?” then you have to immediately dopratikraman for that negative thought.Previously, in the Kramic path, you did penance andrenunciation but even then you could not see your mistakes. Sonow that you have attained this Akram path, get your workdone. People go to their guru and ask for his help for liberationbut how can he free others when he himself is bound? How isone likely to become free when he uses tricks and deceivesothers? There is no one who has the power to bind you. If therewere, then if you were to beseech him and ask for forgiveness,he would. But it is not so. One is bound by one’s own mistakes.Mistakes can be broken when a Gnani Purush points them outand gives instructions to break them. Another solution is toabide by the Gnani Purush’s Agnas (special instructions after theGnan Vidhi).The Lord says, “What keeps you in bondage? Nothingbut continuous hate and vengeful attitude keeps you in bondageAptavani-2171172Aptavani-2Dadashri : No, the fault can never be anyone else’s. Youencounter a nimit (person who is instrumental) because of yourown faults. The one who suffers is verily the one at fault. Thereare consequences in doing something yourself, in making othersdo or encouraging others into doing. You will have to face theconsequences for encouraging and instigating (anumodan)others into doing. Without an action (cause) there can be noreaction (effect).Questioner : What does anumodan mean?Dadashri : If a person is hesitant about doing somethingand you tell him, “Go ahead and do it. I am here with you.” Thatis called anumodan (to give encouragement) and the one whoencourages, carries a greater liability. Who faces a greaterliability for doing something? The consequences are distributedheavily upon the one who uses more intellect. People findmistakes in others but none in themselves. If the mind runscontrary to one’s wishes, he will say he is fed up of this world.If the intellect interferes, he will say that the intellect is beingobstinate. There is endless Ramayana and Mahabharata (wars)within one and he becomes the owner.Who is the owner of the universe ?Every jiva (embodied soul) is the owner of this universe.But one lives like an insect (jivadu) because of ignorance of theSelf. He who has no ownership of the body becomes the ownerof the entire universe. Realization that you are the owner of thewhole world is moksha in itself. Why then are you still not ableto understand this? It is because your mistakes still bind you;otherwise the whole world belongs to you. When someoneinsults you, he does so because there must be an outstandingkarmic account pending with him, so you should accept it andcredit it in your account.

What you see is all attributes ofthe non-self (prakrut gunas) and none of them are permanent.A benevolent person may have that quality for fifty years, butthat quality will change if he were to become delirious. Thequalities or attributes (guna) remain because of the threeprakruti traits of vatta, pitta and kapha. If the three becomeimbalanced, a person would become delirious. One hasaccumulated such qualities for countless lives. Nevertheless, youshould not mix kashays with this. When one accumulates goodprakrut qualities, he will one day be able to attain the Soul. Evena person who has compassion, kindness and patience will hitpeople if the gunas vatta, pitta and kapha were to go bad andbecome imbalanced. These are all attributes of the prakruti(non-self). With such qualities one can bind new merit karmawhile enjoying the fruits of past merit karma (punyanubandhipunya). With it one may encounter a Gnani Purush in somefuture life and attain liberation. But you cannot depend on suchqualities because you never know when they may change. Theseare not the attributes of the pure Soul; they are prakrut qualities.They are not the qualities of the Self; they are qualities of thenon-Self. ‘We’ call them ‘tops’ i.e. the spinning toys.

Who will help you get out? Krupaludev has said thatany embodied soul that escapes the wanderings of the cycle ofeighty-four lakh rebirths, is considered a great one indeed.By meeting a Gnani Purush, you have now found the wayto escape from this horrible web. What can a Gnani Purush dofor your mistakes? He can only show you your mistakes; He canonly shed light on them. He shows you the way out by tellingyou not to protect your mistakes. If you protect your mistakesby saying, “I have to live in this world, how can I do that?” thenyou are nurturing your mistakes. Do not side with your mistakes.First you make a mistake, then you lament endlessly, for that youwill have to wander endlessly.If you want complete freedom and liberty, you will attainit after you destroy all your mistakes. You can only find thosemistakes when you realize who you really are. This happenswhen you become the Self.* * * * *Natural law : Fault is of the suffererThe law of the Lord says whatever the location, whateverthe time, the one who suffers is the one who is at fault. Thereis no need to ask any attorney about it. When someone’s pocketgets picked, the one who picks the pocket is happy. He is eatingand enjoying himself and during that time the one whose pockethe picked is suffering. Therefore the fault is of the one who issuffering. He must have stolen sometime in his past life, forwhich he got caught today therefore he is the guilty one (guiltyof stealing in past life). The other person will be called a thiefand suffer whenever he is caught.‘The fault is of the sufferer’ is a very profound and hiddenelemental principle. Here the intellect will become exhaustedtrying to understand it. The Gnani Purush sheds light wherematignan (knowledge through the medium of the senses andintellect) stops working. This mysterious elemental secret needsto be understood at a very subtle level.There is no one above you; no superior to reprimand you.Your superior is your own mistakes. No one else is at fault here.The sufferer is the one at fault.A doctor gives a shot of medicine to his patient and goeshome and sleeps peacefully. But the patient suffers all night frompain from the shot. Who is at fault here? It is the patient anddoctor’s fault will become evident when he suffers for hismistake.There are two types of languages (bhasha): a language ofillusion (bhranti) and the language of the vitarag. In the languageof the vitarags only the sufferer is at fault.Aptavani-2179180Aptavani-2unfold will only unravel when the time is ripe. The power tounravel these entanglements is not in your hands.

What can a Gnani Purush dofor your mistakes? He can only show you your mistakes; He canonly shed light on them. He shows you the way out by tellingyou not to protect your mistakes. If you protect your mistakesby saying, “I have to live in this world, how can I do that?” thenyou are nurturing your mistakes. Do not side with your mistakes.First you make a mistake, then you lament endlessly, for that youwill have to wander endlessly.If you want complete freedom and liberty, you will attainit after you destroy all your mistakes. You can only find thosemistakes when you realize who you really are. This happenswhen you become the Self.* * * * *Natural law : Fault is of the suffererThe law of the Lord says whatever the location, whateverthe time, the one who suffers is the one who is at fault. Thereis no need to ask any attorney about it. When someone’s pocketgets picked, the one who picks the pocket is happy. He is eatingand enjoying himself and during that time the one whose pockethe picked is suffering. Therefore the fault is of the one who issuffering. He must have stolen sometime in his past life, forwhich he got caught today therefore he is the guilty one (guiltyof stealing in past life). The other person will be called a thiefand suffer whenever he is caught.‘The fault is of the sufferer’ is a very profound and hiddenelemental principle. Here the intellect will become exhaustedtrying to understand it. The Gnani Purush sheds light wherematignan (knowledge through the medium of the senses andintellect) stops working. This mysterious elemental secret needsto be understood at a very subtle level.There is no one above you; no superior to reprimand you.Your superior is your own mistakes. No one else is at fault here.The sufferer is the one at fault.A doctor gives a shot of medicine to his patient and goeshome and sleeps peacefully. But the patient suffers all night frompain from the shot. Who is at fault here? It is the patient anddoctor’s fault will become evident when he suffers for hismistake.There are two types of languages (bhasha): a language ofillusion (bhranti) and the language of the vitarag. In the languageof the vitarags only the sufferer is at fault.Aptavani-2181182Aptavani-2A lady was waiting for a bus. Now is it a crime to standat a bus-stand? The driver of the approaching bus lost controlof the bus and crashed into the bus stand, killing the woman. Ahuge crowd gathered around the accident. If you were to askthese people to pass a judgment on the incident, they will say,“The poor lady died through no fault of hers. How can thewoman be at fault here? The driver is no good. There is no suchthing as God in this world because the poor woman diedthrough no fault of hers.”Just look at the conclusion people arrive at! What ‘we’say is, “The Fault is of the sufferer.” God does exist, what elseis left in this world if there is no such thing as God? People thinkGod has no say in this world anymore; this makes people losefaith in God. You fools, it’s not like that. Life is nothing but acontinuum, an ongoing play of karmic accounts life after life.These accounts are not just of one life. Today that woman’smistake from her previous life was exposed (caught), that is whyshe had to pay for it.In this Kaliyug, accidents and incidents are such thatpeople get confused. What is an accident? An accident meansthat it has ‘too many causes at a time.’ What is an incident? Anincident means that it has ‘so many causes at a time.’ That iswhy ‘we’ say, the fault is of the sufferer. The other person’smistake will become evident when he gets caught.One old man told me, “These days I have to suffer a lot.”‘We’ asked him, “What happened?”He told ‘us’, “My son has become very spoilt.”‘We’ asked him, “Is it just one son or have all of thembecome spoilt?”The old man replied, “One of my four sons drinks alcohol,plays poker, bets on horses, lives in hotels and because of thatI cannot sleep at night worrying about him. I worry about himday and night.”‘We’ told him, “Then the mistake is yours. He does allthat to you because of your own mistakes. Why don’t you enjoythe company of your other three good sons?”‘We’ then spoke with his rebellious son, “Does it notbother you that your father worries so much about you?”The son told ‘us’, “Why should I worry? My fathermakes the money. I am having a good time.”Now between the father and the son, who is suffering?The father is suffering and so the father is at fault. ‘The fault isof the sufferer.’ The son has become worthless; he drinks, hegambles etc., whatever he may be doing, his brothers sleeppeacefully at home, do they not? Does the mother also not sleeppeacefully? Only this old fool stays awake. Therefore he is theone at fault. What fault is this? The fault is that he had corruptedthis boy in his past life and so this is account and interaction dueto the subtle bond of deeds of his past life (roonanubandha),and that is why the old man is suffering. The son will suffer whenhis mistakes mature and express. Who amongst the two is beingroasted and tormented now? The one who is suffering is the oneat fault. If one understands only this one law, then the entire pathof liberation opens up for him.‘The fault is of the sufferer’, this sentence has expressedabsolutely exactly here in front of ‘us’. Whoever uses it will beliberated.If the pavement is uneven and a part of the cement edgeis jutting out, so many people may come and go to the cinemaand yet only Chandulal trips over it. Chandulal will say, ‘Thepavement made me trip.’ Arey! You are the one who bumpedinto the pavement, the pavement does not move, it remains in itsplace. You are the ‘lucky’ one to receive the ‘prize’! Butbecause of illusion, he says, “I was tripped by the pavement.”Aptavani-2181182Aptavani-2A lady was waiting for a bus. Now is it a crime to standat a bus-stand?

If a woman’sAptavani-2189190Aptavani-2accordance with the vyavahar that unfolded with him, but youhave to erase it with pratikraman if you want to go to moksha.Harsh words that come out and hurt the other person isvyavahar too. Why did the speech come out harshly? It comesforth because it was the time for this vyavahar between the two,to unfold. The Lord too accepts this vyavahar.What does it mean when someone insults you? It meanshe has completed his vyavahar with you. Whatever the otherperson does to you, whether he is insulting you or otherwise, heis unfolding the vyavahar with you. Here you have to close thisvyavahar with vyavahar and accept that vyavahar as it is. Do notbring or look for justice in it. You will become entangled if you do.Questioner : What if we have never insulted anyone?Dadashri : If that is the case, then no one will insult you.But because there is a pending karmic account from before, theother person cannot refrain from insulting you. It will come toyou only if it is in your karmic account. Whatever effects comealong, they come because of accounts. Effect in this life is thecause created in one’s past life. The account of effect isvyavahar.Speech unfolds according to vyavahar betweenindividualsHow can we call it vyavahar, if instead of ‘dividing nine bynine’, you ‘divide by twelve’?What is worldly justice? It is to divide nine by twelve.That is why people get entangled within. The worldly justicesays, “He said this to me, and so I should respond in this way.”But if you speak just once, the other person will speak twice asmuch. If you say something twice and the other person will sayit ten times. Vyavahar will continue because they are bothspinning tops (charged pudgal, prakruti). Vyavahar comes to anend when both the tops stop talking.Vyavahar means there is nothing left over, no carryforward for another life; no remainders after division, no pendingkarmic account. In all this, if one wants to go to moksha thenhe should do pratikraman immediately.Do you sometimes say things even when you do not wantto? It happens because such is the vyavahar with the otherperson and based on that vyavahar you end up saying thingsagainst your will. Just think about this point that sometimes evenwhen a person is harming you, you will not say anything to him,but you will speak harsh words to someone who has donenothing to hurt you. Why is that so? It happens because it isdependent on the vyavahar (interaction) with that person.With whatever vyavahar the account was created orwound in the past life, with such a vyavahar it will unfold(unwind) in this life. When you ask me, “Dada why do you nottell me off when I make mistakes?”, ‘we’ will tell you, “You havenot brought such a vyavahar with us. ‘We’ have already alertedyou and cautioned you based on whatever extra vyavahar youhad brought with you. You did not bring any more vyavahar thanthat.” Gnani Purush never has harsh speech and if His speechcomes out harshly for others, ‘we’ do not like it. And despitethis if ‘we’ ever speak harshly, ‘we’ immediately realize thatsuch is the vyavahar ‘we’ have brought with that person. Thewords that come out are in accordance with the vyavahar of theperson one is dealing with. The speech of the Gnani Purush isnimit-dependent. The speech of the vitarag, or the Gnani who hasno ambitions, no desires, no raag-dwesh, is nimit dependent. Thespeech of the Gnani can never be hurtful to others. The GnaniPurush does not have the time to insult anyone. Nevertheless,someone with tremendous punyas will have the rare occasion tobe scolded by the Gnani. This person’s vyavahar is such that inorder to rid him of his ‘disease’, the Gnani has to speak to himin a harsh manner. Otherwise, why would ‘we’ do so? TheGnani gives liberation in just one hour, why would he have aAptavani-2189190Aptavani-2accordance with the vyavahar that unfolded with him, but youhave to erase it with pratikraman if you want to go to moksha.Harsh words that come out and hurt the other person isvyavahar too. Why did the speech come out harshly? It comesforth because it was the time for this vyavahar between the two,to unfold. The Lord too accepts this vyavahar.What does it mean when someone insults you? It meanshe has completed his vyavahar with you. Whatever the otherperson does to you, whether he is insulting you or otherwise, heis unfolding the vyavahar with you. Here you have to close thisvyavahar with vyavahar and accept that vyavahar as it is. Do notbring or look for justice in it. You will become entangled if you do.Questioner : What if we have never insulted anyone?Dadashri : If that is the case, then no one will insult you.But because there is a pending karmic account from before, theother person cannot refrain from insulting you. It will come toyou only if it is in your karmic account. Whatever effects comealong, they come because of accounts. Effect in this life is thecause created in one’s past life. The account of effect isvyavahar.Speech unfolds according to vyavahar betweenindividualsHow can we call it vyavahar, if instead of ‘dividing nine bynine’, you ‘divide by twelve’?What is worldly justice? It is to divide nine by twelve.That is why people get entangled within. The worldly justicesays, “He said this to me, and so I should respond in this way.”But if you speak just once, the other person will speak twice asmuch. If you say something twice and the other person will sayit ten times. Vyavahar will continue because they are bothspinning tops (charged pudgal, prakruti). Vyavahar comes to anend when both the tops stop talking.Vyavahar means there is nothing left over, no carryforward for another life; no remainders after division, no pendingkarmic account. In all this, if one wants to go to moksha thenhe should do pratikraman immediately.Do you sometimes say things even when you do not wantto? It happens because such is the vyavahar with the otherperson and based on that vyavahar you end up saying thingsagainst your will. Just think about this point that sometimes evenwhen a person is harming you, you will not say anything to him,but you will speak harsh words to someone who has donenothing to hurt you. Why is that so? It happens because it isdependent on the vyavahar (interaction) with that person.With whatever vyavahar the account was created orwound in the past life, with such a vyavahar it will unfold(unwind) in this life. When you ask me, “Dada why do you nottell me off when I make mistakes?”, ‘we’ will tell you, “You havenot brought such a vyavahar with us. ‘We’ have already alertedyou and cautioned you based on whatever extra vyavahar youhad brought with you. You did not bring any more vyavahar thanthat.” Gnani Purush never has harsh speech and if His speechcomes out harshly for others, ‘we’ do not like it. And despitethis if ‘we’ ever speak harshly, ‘we’ immediately realize thatsuch is the vyavahar ‘we’ have brought with that person. Thewords that come out are in accordance with the vyavahar of theperson one is dealing with. The speech of the Gnani Purush isnimit-dependent. The speech of the vitarag, or the Gnani who hasno ambitions, no desires, no raag-dwesh, is nimit dependent. Thespeech of the Gnani can never be hurtful to others.

If oneof the disciples felt slighted, that disciple would not be able tosleep all night. What can the Lord do about that? Why shouldone be seeking justice in that? If you accept vyavahar asvyavahar then you will understand justice. Why did yourneighbor say negative things to you? He did so because suchwas your vyavahar with him. The words that come out of yourmouth are dependent upon your vyavahar with the other person.But you want to go to moksha, so you should do pratikraman.Questioner : But what happens once the ‘arrow’ is shot?Dadashri : It is vyavahar dependent.Questioner : Will such ongoing interactions not createvengeance and enmity?Dadashri : No. That is why we do pratikraman.Pratikraman will not take you to moksha but it is a link with Godin the other person to avoid creating vengeance. Vengeance willbe created if you are slack in doing pratikraman. Do pratikramanthe moment you realize your mistake. Doing so will never createvengeance, even if the other person wants to, because you senda direct message to the God within him. There is no solution orremedy for this worldly interaction. Do pratikraman only if youwant moksha. In the absence of knowledge of the Self, if youwant to continue to maintain the worldly interactions as theworldly interactions they are, then if the other person curses you,you are to see it as being correct. But if you want moksha, thenyou have to do pratikraman also, otherwise the other person willbind enmity.Completion of worldly interaction is the final solutionThe Lord has said, “There is vyavahar and there isreason to insult anyone? But these harsh words come forth inorder to rid the other person of all his ‘diseases’.What does Kavi say?‘The one, whom Dada calls ‘mooah’ (mortal)!, becomes ajaramar (ageless and immortal). When dada ‘tells off’ someoneby referring to him as a ‘mooah’, it will destroy many of hissins. Dada’s insult, on the contrary, is a blessing for him.’Someone may ask, “Why is Dada speaking harshly withthis man?” What can Dada do when the man has brought sucha vyavahar? Some people are worthless and yet Dada will notraise his voice at them. Does that not tell you how wonderful avyavahar they have brought? Those who have brought harshvyavahar with them will experience harsh words from ‘us’.Sometimes at home, ‘we’ get served tea without anysugar. ‘We’ drink it without saying a word. Many times evenHiraba (wife of Dadashri) is not aware of this, she will onlyrealize it if she drinks the tea herself. ‘We’ do not have to sayanything as far as the daily activities are concerned. ‘We’ onlyhave to say anything if something new is being installed in thehouse, but putting sugar in the tea is routine. It is only today thatshe forgot the sugar, so what is the need for saying anything. Toput sugar in the tea is vyavahar and so if tea without sugar isserved, ‘we’ would understand that that is the vyavahar of theday. Therefore, ‘we’ would drink the tea without saying anything.What kind of justice in vyavahar?Vyavahar is the very thing that creates entanglements andproblems everywhere. There is no connection between vyavaharand justice. People look for justice, however justice is notsomething one should seek or call for. If a mother-in-lawmistreats her daughter-in-law, that is vyavahar and it is alsovyavahar if she treats her with respect and care. This body(pudgal) would not exist if there was no vyavahar.

What does vyavahar say?Why is it that the other person gave you only eight when heowed you eighteen? It is because the vyavahar was only of eightand therefore by giving only eight, that vyavahar is ‘zeroed out’completely; the karmic debt of past life is paid off. If the GnaniPurush has given you Gnan, then you will not charge any morenew karma. Otherwise karmas will be charged for the next life.The person who expects the other ten will bind karma, bydemanding externally or internally and complicating the interaction.Vyavahar means that which ends the karmic accounts ofboth the involved parties. It is that which ends the gross karmasi.e. karmas perceived through the five senses and karmas thatone can experience. For the one who has not attained theknowledge of the Self, the vyavahar leaves but it simultaneouslycharges new karmas for the next life. For the one who is Selfrealized, there is only discharge of the vyavahar. There is no newcharging of karma. The discharge may be of any kind but thatwhich discharges is exactly in accordance with the vyavahar withthat person.Some will respond with ingratitude no matter how obligingor benevolent you are to them. You will lose your mind if youstart to look for justice there. Even the authorities and theattorneys will go crazy. It is vyavahar when a person practicesbenevolence and it is also vyavahar when a person is beingmalevolent. If you bring in an arbitrator to carry out justice, hewill start making all kinds of demands on you – bring me sometea and snacks!Why do you look for justice where there is vyavahar(ongoing worldly interaction)? If you do not accept this, thenvyavahar itself will compel you into accepting it. So why notunderstand once and for all, that it is nothing but vyavahar.Questioner : Dada when one experiences turmoil andagitation within, is that because of contempt?Dadashri : It happens because you did not deal with thatparticular vyavahar in an amicable manner in the past. ‘We’ maybe rebuking someone in this vyavahar but there is no selfishmotive on ‘our’ part, so ‘our’ vyavahar is amicable and pleasantand the result is wonderful. But if someone rebukes with selfishmotives or for reasons of partiality, then the result is bitter. ‘Our’vyavahar is very attractive and pleasant. ‘We’ get credit foreverything without doing anything.

Animals too have problems with old age, but they haveto suffer them silently.Farmers make their bullocks work all day long but theyput a muzzle around the bullocks’ mouths so that they would notgraze on their farms. A bullock understands that he is notallowed to eat. One farmer in his eagerness to watch a movieat night put down some nice grass for his bullock to eat butforgot to take the muzzle off. What can the poor bullock do? Hefelt the hunger pangs but what could he do? Whom could hetell? The farmer returned from the movies late at night and wentstraight to bed without checking on his bullock. The bullockkept stomping his feet on the ground all night long. In themorning when the farmer woke up, he realized that he hadforgotten to remove the muzzle!Life is like that of a bull working in an oil millFor countless lives, man has worked like a bull in an oilmill and what has been his reward? A slice of oil cake! After agrueling day at work, the man gets to eat some handvo (heavydry spicy bread) at night, and the bull in the oil mill gets a sliceof an oil cake! One has suffered a lot of misery. He has sufferedendlessly just like the bull. They invite all kinds of imaginarymiseries again. This is like people who send out weddingAptavani-2199200Aptavani-2their problems, because they understand there is nothing to say.Does anyone have the ability to take away someone else’sproblems? Is the other person able to take over your problems?Do animals come to complain about their problems? If a carruns over a dog’s leg, whom is the dog going to complain to?The poor dog has to drag his leg everywhere it goes withoutgetting any treatment for it.Do the animals have in-laws? It is only when one comesinto the human life that one has husbands and in-laws. In whichlife did one not have a husband? One had ‘husbands’ even in adog’s life and a donkey’s life and yet this is what they like, dothey not? Otherwise, one is the supreme soul (parmatma). Oneattains the human birth for the purpose of liberation, but heforgets that! There is no greater fool than the one who forgetswhy he has come in this world. All he has done in this worldlylife is claim ‘This is my wife’, ‘this is my husband’, ‘this is mymother-in-law’, ‘this is my father-in-law’, ‘this is mine’, this ismine, etc.’; that is all one has done. But when he is sick or hasa toothache and really needs someone, no one is around. Whenthe old mother-in-law has a toothache, she tells her daughter-in-law, “My tooth is hurting. Tell me what I can do about it.” Butthe daughter-in-law thinks, “Why does this old woman keepcomplaining and nagging?” She will realize this pain when herown tooth starts to hurt, but right now she forgets the pain shehad experienced in the past. People make mistakes and thenthey forget, and when they have to suffer the consequences oftheir mistakes, they question, “Why me?”Accounts on booksThis worldly life is worth understanding. Who are theseuncles, aunts, wives, etc.? They are all accounts on the booksof karma created in the previous life. No one has realized this.If they did, they would start clearing these accounts of creditsand debits. Because people do not have this realization, theycreate new accounts in the process of clearing old ones. If thereinvitations, to the most distant of distant relatives. Hey you! Whynot invite the ones whose presence is necessary? They invite allkinds of miseries, and all kinds of miseries do come. Neitherhappiness nor misery has a preference as to where it goes, butit will come for sure once people invite them. But then peoplestart protesting, why does misery come our way? It comesbecause you invited it just like the most distant relative.When the women in villages get together, they talk abouttheir happiness and their sorrows. One woman would begin, “Iam going to give my husband a piece of my mind.” The menwhen they get together are also discussing their wives. One willstart, “I am going to slap her one of these days.” Then look whathappens. She tells him off and he slaps her. This is how theworld is. How many things are necessary in this worldly life? Allone needs is two meals a day and water to drink; it is fine if hedoes not get water for a bath. Does one have dandruff withshort hair? But people grow their hair long and then haveproblems with dandruff. People invite unnecessary miseries.The worldly life is nothing but a treasury of misery, whereone cannot complain. One can not say a word, say anything toanyone, and neither can he suffer it. On top of that he has toswallow its bitterness.

Why does one experience only happiness and anotheronly misery? It is because of the kind of accounts he has broughtwith him. Everyday we hear stories in the news: A man isrobbed in a taxi. A husband and wife were tied up and robbedin their apartment, etc. There is no need for you to fear it willhappen to you too, after reading such news. This projection(vikalp) of fear verily is the fault and will have to suffer itsconsequences. Instead, why not move about naturally? You willbe robbed only if it is in your account, otherwise no one has thetime to meddle with you. ‘The fault is of the sufferer’, hence youshould go about without any fear. The newspapers will report allkinds of things, but does that mean you have to be scared? Itis a good thing that the divorce rate is low, but when it increases,people will find a cause to worry about their own divorces! Donot be afraid even if a hundred thousand people are robbed.There is no one above you as your boss.If an astrologer reads the palm of your hand and tells youthat you have four situations that could cause death (ghaat),then you have to be careful during those situations. Now if youovercome one such situation and find yourself living, then feelhappy that there is one less in the balance. In the same token,when someone insults you or you have to face an unpleasantsituation, you should be happy that there is one less account inthe remaining balance. Instead, people become engrossed insuch situations. That should not happen. If you have an accountof a thousand abuses and someone abuses you, you should tellyourself that at least one is gone from the thousand, now thereare only 999 left! You should not have the burden of, ‘Why didhe insult me?’ If you surrender your miseries to ‘Dada’, then youare free. ‘We’ have come to take away the miseries of thiswhole world.

Tell Dada, “Dada, I have always been foolish so pleasebe there for me.” And Dada will always be present.The sense of pleasure which exists when someonecompliments you and praises you should also be there whensomeone insults you. Why is there no pleasure at the time ofinsults? It is because one does not say, “There is joy for sureduring insults.” If you say this, then it will be there. But if yousay, “I do not remember this at the time,” then how will youremember during the insult. There is infinite energy of the Selfwithin you.

It will end up with something peculiar and newaltogether. A person may have a very high social status, butpeople around him will say, “Don’t even talk about him!” Why?Because he is useless. So is there not a need to look for the wayout of this misery? How can one become free form misery?When does a person understand there is no happiness inthe worldly life? The understanding comes when one experiencesproblems and suffering. All accounts are filled with endless painand suffering. But during times of happiness, one wanders aboutin a state of care free elation (masti) and then when heencounters difficulties he realizes that the worldly life is full ofmisery. Once you throw away your gold into the sea, are yougoing to be able to recover it? Then there is nothing you can dobut cry bitterly. Similarly, how can this worldly life improve onceit has been ruined? Improvement can only come through thewords of a vitarag; Only He (the Gnani Purush) can give youmoksha. How can you afford to have the bondage of the body,the speech, the mind, the intellect and the ego etc.? All these arecompletely separate from the Self but you have made them allas one by saying, “I am the mind, I am the ego”, and this rendersyou as the deluded self (muddhatma, ‘I am Chandulal’).Otherwise, if You become separate from all these, You verily arethe supreme Self (parmatma). You have become deludedbecause you believe that happiness lies in all these temporarythings.Really there is no such thing as misery and suffering;misery and suffering exist because of your wrong beliefs. Do youreceive letters from your loved ones who have departed andgone?Questioner : No, how can they come?Dadashri : That is how this worldly life is. If you have acredit of Rupees 500 in your account from your previous life,you will come across someone in this life who will settle thisaccount. He will be instrumental in your receiving 500 Rupees.Once the accounts are settled, that person will leave and youwill not encounter him again. People separate, they go their ownway, they die. Then you will not meet each other again if no newkarmic accounts are created.This china set of cups and saucers worth a hundreddollars will be here with you as long as your karmic account isthere with them. When that relationship comes to an end, theywill break. When they break, it is vyavasthit and you should notkeep remembering them after that. Are people also not like thecups and the saucers? You merely witness with your eyes thatthey died, but in reality they do not die, they come back hereagain. That is why, when you do their pratikraman, it reachesthem. It will reach them wherever they are.Behold the One who swallows all the bitternessQuestioner : Dada, when someone uses bitter wordstowards me, it is difficult to tolerate them. What should I do?Dadashri : Let me clarify that for you. Say there is athorn lying on the road. Thousands of people walk by it andnothing happens to them. But when Chandubhai walks by, thethorn somehow pierces his foot through and through eventhough it was pointing sideways. Experience of bitterness is dueentirely to the account of karma. So when that happens, believeand understand that that much bitterness is now being deductedfrom the pending account of bitterness. Pleasure that isexperienced is also reduced by that amount from the pendingaccount. Yet, when one experiences pain and bitterness, he doesnot like it. Why does he not like the painful experience evenwhen it is being reduced from the pending account? If he asksfor more bitterness from the one who is serving it to him, if herequests the man to insult him some more, the man would not.It is not under the hands of the one who is serving the bitterness.Aptavani-2203204Aptavani-2wind, fire and space; is very complex and does not remainnatural.

Everything is very precise,methodical and balanced. There are pending accounts; this is nolie. There is accountability in everything up until death. Allaccounts are very precise. Some people will give you more,some less. There will be no suffering, if Gnan prevails during theprocess. All relations are relative. Bitter or sweet, they are allconsequences of past karmic account. The one, who mistreatsyou everyday, may one day be very kind and caring to you.These are all relationships of giving. They are the result ofkarmic accounts created in the past life.‘We’ too have been served a lot of bitterness. ‘We’swallowed it all and now all the accounts are finished. ‘We’drank the bitterness from anyone who served it to ‘us’ and inreturn, ‘we’ blessed them as ‘we’ drank it! That is precisely why‘we’ became Mahadevji (the one who swallows the bitternessthat others give him at the same time he gives blessing to him).Questioner : Is that the same as settling the account ofkarma?Dadashri : Yes, it is the same thing; when bitter giftscome your way, accept them. Instead people react by asking,“Why are you doing this to me?’ when they are faced with bittergifts. They are not able to shed that karma by reacting this wayand on the contrary, they create new accounts of bitterness.Those who have the knowledge of the Self, those who nowwant to get rid of this ‘business’, will bring about a closure ofall this. Those who do not have the knowledge of the Self, theirbusiness of charging new karma continue.As long as one does not know from which account aperson is sending the bitter experience, he does not like it. Butwhen he understands which account it is coming from, ‘Oh hoho, it is from this account!’ he likes it. All of Dada’s bitteraccounts are paid off, so who is going to give Him anybitterness? People will only come to pay you back if you havea balance pending.Here, satsang provides constant bliss. Elsewhere outsidethere is no bliss to be found. That is why people derive pleasurefrom things they believe gives them pleasure. The pleasure theyderive is based on their beliefs rather than their knowledge(experience). Worldly pleasure arises from wrong beliefs. Itwould be fine if one is even aware of this fact but he does notmake any progress because of his prevailing wrong belief. Evenif he were to critically analyze the nature of pleasure, he wouldbe able to understand its illusion and imaginary nature. But aslong as these wrong beliefs prevail, he will find pleasure only intransient things.If positive circumstances come together, pleasure (sookha)arises and when negative circumstances come together, pain(dookha) arises. If a person gets into a company of gamblersand drunkards, then those circumstances will make him miserableand if he encounters circumstances are to sit in satsang, thenpleasure will arise. By the company one keeps one canunderstand the nature of his suffering, whether it is one ofpleasure or pain.Real and imaginary painThe Self does not have any pain or suffering. Pain andsuffering is experienced by some other entity, but because thereis no understanding of this, one takes on the misery on tohimself. Misery is not having food to eat or water to drink fordays. Despite having food and water, the mind that is spoilt(dusham mun) will collect a stock of pain and misery. How canone call this pain and misery? Suffering is not having food to eat,or clothes to wear, or a place to sleep; these are miseries. Howcan you say you are suffering when you have all these? Peopleare miserable because their minds have become spoilt and whenthe mind becomes healthy (susham), they will become happy.When the mind becomes spoilt, it invites anxieties even whenAptavani-2205206Aptavani-2Nothing is under anyone’s control.

Granted that a person with atoothache is suffering, but otherwise there is no suffering and yetpeople have become so restless.Anything for which there is a solution or a cure can becalled suffering. In fact, it can only be called pain or suffering ifthere is a solution for it. If there is no solution, then it is notconsidered suffering. When there is pain, do we not look forsolutions and cures? If a person loses a leg in a war, that leg isnot going to come back and so it cannot be called suffering(dookha), but if he has an abscess on the face, that is sufferingbecause it is possible to cure it; there is a solution for it.A person may say, “I am happy in all respects but I justhave this itching eczema on my leg.” Arey! How can you call thispain? When it itches the hand is handy to automatically scratchthe itch, is it not?Questioner : But, Dada our financial situation haschanged for the worse, what about that?Dadashri : That will keep changing. Does night notfollow day? Today you may not have a job but tomorrow youmay have a new job. Both situations change. There are manytimes when one has no financial problems. But greed has takenhold of him. All you have to be concerned with is whether thereis enough money in the home to buy some vegetables fortomorrow, nothing more. Now, tell me do you have suchsuffering?Questioner : No!Dadashri : Then how can you call that suffering? Onekeeps crying about suffering when no suffering exists. Thisneedless complaining leads to restlessness and heart attacks.That which cannot be treated is not called suffering. One mustdo whatever is necessary to decrease the suffering. But, whenno treatment exists, it is not called suffering.What is the current era of this time cycle like? In this eraone is preoccupied with ways and means by which he can makemoney, how he can exploit and deprive others, how he can selladulterated goods, how he can obtain sexual gratification fromthat which is not rightfully his. He can only look for somethingelse if he can get a break from all these preoccupations, right?None of these have provided any meaningful happiness.Meaningful happiness can only arise if one pursues the ‘mainproduction’ (the Self). The worldly life is a byproduct. Oneattains this body, worldly comforts, a wife, a home etc. as aresult of good deeds in the past life. If it were possible to getthese things through sheer hard work, then even a laborer shouldget them, but that is not the case. There is a misconceptionamongst people today and hence they have started ‘factories’ ofby-production (money and pursuit of imagined pleasure). Youshould not start the business of by-production. Main productionmeans to attain moksha from a Gnani Purush, and then thebyproducts of worldly comforts will come as a bonus. Countlesslives have been wasted through wrongful meditation (dhyan) foracquiring the byproducts. For once, attain moksha and all yourproblems will be solved.Questioner : What happens when a person commitssuicide?Dadashri : A person may die by committing suicide buthe will have to come back to pay off his debts and obligations.As a human, one is bound to face difficulties, but does that meanone has to commit suicide? The consequences of committingsuicide are extremely serious. The Lord has forbidden suicidebecause its consequences are very grave. One should not eventhink of committing suicide. Resolve to pay off whateveroutstanding debts you may have, but do not even think ofsuicide.Lord Ramchandraji faced tremendous pain and suffering.Aptavani-2207208Aptavani-2there is no cause for anxieties. Granted that a person with atoothache is suffering, but otherwise there is no suffering and yetpeople have become so restless.Anything for which there is a solution or a cure can becalled suffering. In fact, it can only be called pain or suffering ifthere is a solution for it. If there is no solution, then it is notconsidered suffering. When there is pain, do we not look forsolutions and cures? If a person loses a leg in a war, that leg isnot going to come back and so it cannot be called suffering(dookha), but if he has an abscess on the face, that is sufferingbecause it is possible to cure it; there is a solution for it.A person may say, “I am happy in all respects but I justhave this itching eczema on my leg.” Arey! How can you call thispain? When it itches the hand is handy to automatically scratchthe itch, is it not?Questioner : But, Dada our financial situation haschanged for the worse, what about that?Dadashri : That will keep changing. Does night notfollow day? Today you may not have a job but tomorrow youmay have a new job. Both situations change. There are manytimes when one has no financial problems. But greed has takenhold of him. All you have to be concerned with is whether thereis enough money in the home to buy some vegetables fortomorrow, nothing more. Now, tell me do you have suchsuffering?Questioner : No!Dadashri : Then how can you call that suffering? Onekeeps crying about suffering when no suffering exists. Thisneedless complaining leads to restlessness and heart attacks.That which cannot be treated is not called suffering. One mustdo whatever is necessary to decrease the suffering.

Physicalsuffering is called ‘kasht’; it is direct and real suffering.Toothaches, eye aches, paralysis etc. are all bodily pains. Thehurt suffered from harsh words is a ‘ghaa’. It will never leave.And the third suffering is of the mind, which is called ‘dookha’.We should no longer have the effect of pain due to the mind orspeech. We will have an effect from bodily pain and this has tobe suffered. But you should suffer it by remaining as the Self, theknower and the seer of the suffering. You should not havesuffering of the mind and speech. When a tax officer tells youthat you have to pay so much tax, it is just a ‘record’ that isspeaking and therefore it should not hurt you.When someone has a heart attack, he has severe chestpain.

Whatever misery, pain orsuffering there is, there is always a cure for it. It is considereda misery when you have a toothache because you can go to adentist and get treatment for it or you can have that tooth pulled.What is suffering? It is anything for which there is a solution.Wherever there is no solution, it cannot be called suffering. Herethe child has a pound worth of pain, but why does the fathertake on another half a pound on to himself? Dogs do not crywhen their puppies get hurt, they merely lick the wound to healit. There is a healing power in their saliva. And when the doggets hurt, it will cry out loudly! These humans however are non-dependant (nirashrit), i.e. those who take on doer-ship. Theybecome miserable even when someone else is in pain.One man came to me and told me, “I have a big problemof pain (pida).” ‘We’ asked him what it was and he said, “Mywife is going to be delivering a baby.” Is the wife having a babysomething new?

Otherwise he would become consumed with negativethoughts of, ‘the neighbor’s wife died during childbirth, what ifthat happens to my wife too?’ If one has negative thoughts likethis, he is bound to be affected by them. He takes on this painand if he continues to think negatively like this, it will create aproblem even if it was not meant to be. The effect of negativethoughts is an unfavorable outcome. Everything will work outfine if you do not think excessively about things. Whenever youstart thinking or worrying, that work is ruined for sure. This isbecause these thoughts stem from one who has an ego and istherefore independent (nirashrit). It would be a different matterif these thoughts arose in the ashrit (egoless, dependant, e.g.animals).This person says, “That woman said this to me and hurtme.” That is not pain because it does not touch him physically.These invited problems are not pain. People take on the burdenof pain of their children when their children die, but why do theynot accompany them when they die? They will not do so.Gnanis are very wise. They have figured out everything.And with the current era of this time cycle being what it is, don’tyou think that it affects the Gnani too? Do you think the Gnanidoes not encounter any pain in this time cycle? He does, but theGnani makes all the arrangements ahead of time. Just as the postoffice does. In the post office they have cubby holes for sortingthe mail; mail for Nadiad, mail for Surat, mail for the office, etc.Likewise Gnani places the pains in appropriate boxes, the boxof business, the box of society, the box of office and then goesto sleep with ease.It is possible to have no pain whatsoever after attainingthe Self.If the ceiling of a cinema collapses, you should be pleasedthat no one got hurt, and if someone does get hurt then youshould be pleased that no one died.

The only thing that concerns you is thatwhich touches the body. If your father’s body gets affected withpain, do not take it upon your own mind. Nevertheless, you stillhave to inquire as to what happened to him. Thereafter you haveto get all the necessary medical treatment and medicines for him,but remain detached, just as you would in a play. If this life wasnot a drama (temporary), then the son is obliged to go with thefather when the father dies, is that not so? How is it that we treatlife like a drama when it comes to death, but not when it comesto someone in pain?Why is this Gnani Purush in eternal bliss? It is because Heknows how to deal with everything and He teaches you how todo the same. You do not know how to deal with things, that iswhy you have put us on the pedestal.When a student does not know how to multiply, despitebeing taught several times, the teacher will hit him. Hey you!Why not become a teacher in your own home? He would refuseto do that because the wife will beat him up!Abuse of power is sheer stupidityIf a person attains power and uses that power, he isnothing but an idiot. Anyone who uses his power is an idiot.When one does not have the power, he will contemplate onusing his power when he attains it, but when he does, that poweris not to be used. When ‘we’ call anyone who uses his power,‘an idiot’, ‘we’ get rid of his disease. Until now no one hascalled him names and no one will. But unless someone does, hewill not be rid of his disease. Why do people say, “WelcomeSheth (big boss), welcome Sheth?” It is because they haveselfish motives. Everyone has selfish motives and expectations.Such people (those whose ego becomes inflated when peoplegive them importance) can only be brought back to earth whena man without any expectations insults them.An attorney once came to me. ‘We’ insulted and scoldedhim to no end. He went home and told his brother, “I have neverseen such a compassionate man before.” Generally people thinkdoctors and lawyers will be useful to them some day. But ofwhat use can they be? The only thing of any use is a little food,even if it is a little khichadee; nothing else is of any use. Peoplewould realize what exactly is useful when they do not get evena little khichadee to eat. People will realize just how useful aperson is when even the smallest of their expectations is notfulfilled by that person.A Gnani Purush does not have any concern with respector insults. The pleasure derived from respect is pleasure that isfalse, subjective and temporary. As long as one has a fear ofbeing insulted, it can be said that one has not attained any gnan(knowledge). The only thing worth attaining, is the knowledge ofthe vitarag Lords; the Gnan. Nothing else is needed.Some people come here driven by misery. But a lot canbe achieved if one comes here with a keen desire for Gnan.People look to God when misery is upon them, but God says,“When times were good you did not even remember me andnow that you are miserable, you call me, but ‘we’ will notrespond to your call.”Let me explain what people do. The pain and sufferingthey suffer in this life is really the effect of their past life’s causes.In the current life they perpetuate that same effect over and overagain by creating new causes, as the effects of the past causesare unfolding. A person can only make progress if he does notcreate new causes in the unfolding effects.Aptavani-2215216Aptavani-2news that five hundred tons of steel fell into the sea, the firstthing ‘we’ ask is, “We haven’t lost any men, have we?” Onedies according to the timing of his karmic account, but weshould not be instrumental in the process.Keep everything compartmentalized; put everything in itsappropriate account.

You do not know how to deal with things, that iswhy you have put us on the pedestal.When a student does not know how to multiply, despitebeing taught several times, the teacher will hit him. Hey you!Why not become a teacher in your own home? He would refuseto do that because the wife will beat him up!Abuse of power is sheer stupidityIf a person attains power and uses that power, he isnothing but an idiot. Anyone who uses his power is an idiot.When one does not have the power, he will contemplate onusing his power when he attains it, but when he does, that poweris not to be used. When ‘we’ call anyone who uses his power,‘an idiot’, ‘we’ get rid of his disease. Until now no one hascalled him names and no one will. But unless someone does, hewill not be rid of his disease. Why do people say, “WelcomeSheth (big boss), welcome Sheth?” It is because they haveselfish motives. Everyone has selfish motives and expectations.Such people (those whose ego becomes inflated when peoplegive them importance) can only be brought back to earth whena man without any expectations insults them.An attorney once came to me. ‘We’ insulted and scoldedhim to no end. He went home and told his brother, “I have neverseen such a compassionate man before.” Generally people thinkdoctors and lawyers will be useful to them some day. But ofwhat use can they be? The only thing of any use is a little food,even if it is a little khichadee; nothing else is of any use. Peoplewould realize what exactly is useful when they do not get evena little khichadee to eat. People will realize just how useful aperson is when even the smallest of their expectations is notfulfilled by that person.A Gnani Purush does not have any concern with respector insults. The pleasure derived from respect is pleasure that isfalse, subjective and temporary. As long as one has a fear ofbeing insulted, it can be said that one has not attained any gnan(knowledge). The only thing worth attaining, is the knowledge ofthe vitarag Lords; the Gnan. Nothing else is needed.Some people come here driven by misery. But a lot canbe achieved if one comes here with a keen desire for Gnan.People look to God when misery is upon them, but God says,“When times were good you did not even remember me andnow that you are miserable, you call me, but ‘we’ will notrespond to your call.”Let me explain what people do. The pain and sufferingthey suffer in this life is really the effect of their past life’s causes.In the current life they perpetuate that same effect over and overagain by creating new causes, as the effects of the past causesare unfolding. A person can only make progress if he does notcreate new causes in the unfolding effects.Aptavani-2217218Aptavani-2‘This’ is the station that you have arrived at, where youcan get your work (for moksha) done. Therefore eat, drink andenjoy the circumstances that are directly in front of you and donot be concerned about the circumstances that are not.Bliss will arise from within. Instead people are searchingfor it externally.Why does one have thoughts about becoming an ascetic?It is because he remembers the beatings he has taken in endlesspast lives from having a mother-in-law, a father-in-law, otherworldly miseries, a husband, a wife, children etc. That personwill even find a nimit, someone who will tell him there is nohappiness in the worldly life. And that is why he thinks abouttaking dixa (diksha; renounce worldly life) and he ends updoing so.All your pains will go away in the presence of the GnaniPurush. All your pains can disappear in front of this Gnani,provided you do not have any desires. If you have a dressing onyour wounded leg and the Gnani tells you not to remove it andyou still do, then what can anyone do? How can you ignore theinstructions of the Gnani?Every morning when you get up, recall Dada and make afirm decision and recite five times, “Let there not be any hurt toany living being in the world through my mind, speech and body,even in the slightest degree.” When you make such a firmdecision (nischay) the inner ‘police department’ is thus alerted.There is a huge army of enemies within. You attain tremendousenergies by reciting this in the presence of the Gnani Purush andthose energies will not ever leave you. Make this decision bykeeping Dada as your witness. Then you should not give anynourishment to the army of inner kashays even if they arise.Kantado : displeasure of boredom and fatigueDadashri : What is the meaning of kantado (physicaland mental displeasure)?Questioner : It is when you do not like anything.Dadashri : It is the state that one is in when he sleeps ona bed of thorns. Do you do anything to remove it? Do you takeany medicine when this sets in?Questioner : There is no medicine for it anywhere.Dadashri : But you must be doing something for it?Questioner : I just go out for a walk.Dadashri : That is tantamount to sending back thosewhom you owe. What does kantado tell you? What is naturetelling you? It is asking you to make a due payment. But yousay, “No, I will not do that”, and then you run awayunnecessarily. You are pushing away the displeasure of boredomand fatigue (kantado). What will happen when they all collectivelycome to make a demand on you? When kantado sets in, onegoes out to watch a movie. This is dealing with it in a wrongmanner. One is resorting to a contrary solution. If you remain stillwhen this state of displeasure of boredom and fatigue sets in,you will be able to find out what it is and where it came from.You will be able to look for the reasons behind it. This gives youthe opportunity to awaken the process of going towards the Self(purusharth dharma). But instead, you go in the wrongdirection and push it away.Questioner : It does not go away even when I go out.Dadashri : By going out during kantado, the bloodcirculates and therefore the circumstances of displeasure disperse.Questioner : There are some who will drink whiskeywhen this happens.Dadashri : They are trying to solve the problem ofboredom by drinking and running around.

I worship Thakorji thechild Krishna, whose idol image has been worshipped a lot(pratishtha) and is now established in our home.Dadashri : Yes, but He is worthy of worship and that iswhy He is respected. You should not worship anyone who is notworthy of worship. Do not worship for the sake of worshipping,but worship with right understanding (pujya buddhi). Do youhave pujya buddhi for Thakorji?

Even the temple was in a state of gloom and sowere the worshippers. When the priest saw laughter on LordRamchandraji’s face, he ran towards the Lord and placed agarland around his neck. ‘We’ asked him why he did that.

Such a Gnanican do anything He aims. He can make an idol talk. Do you nottalk with an idol? Do you not have the freedom to talk? If theAptavani-2221222Aptavani-2idol does not talk to you, at least you can talk. What is wrongin that? You should say, “Lord, why don’t you talk to me? Doyou not have trust in me?” Do people not laugh if you say thesame thing to them? That idol will laugh. Do you have one ortwo idols?Questioner : One.Dadashri : Do you bathe Thakorji (the idol)?Questioner : Yes. I do it everyday.Dadashri : With cold water or hot water?Questioner : With warm water.Dadashri : That is good. Otherwise Thakorji will feelcold if you use cold water and hot water can scald. Therefore,you need warm water. Do you feed Thakorji everyday or doyou make Him fast (agiyaras)?Questioner : Even I do not fast.Dadashri : There is no problem if you do not fast, but doyou feed Thakorji?Questioner : Yes.Dadashri : What time do you feed Him?Questioner : I put Him to sleep after feeding Him at eightin the morning and then I go to work after taking the foodoffered to Thakorji (prasad).Dadashri : Do you then eat in the afternoon?Questioner : I eat anywhere I can when I get hungry.Dadashri : Yes, but do you check up on Thakorji if Heis hungry or not?Questioner : How can I do that when I am at work?Dadashri : Poor Thakorji would cry then! What can Hedo if He is hungry? So will you do one thing ‘we’ ask? Will you?Questioner : I will definitely do it, Dada.Dadashri : Whenever you sit down to eat, rememberThakorji and offer him the food first ‘Thakorji eat first. You mustbe hungry. I will eat after you.’ Then you can eat. Will you dothis much? Say yes if you can and no if you cannot.Questioner : But Dada, I put Him to sleep and thencome to work!Dadashri : No, but even though you put Him to sleep,He would still be hungry would he not? That is why He does nottalk! How long will He remain asleep? He will wake up and thengo back to sleep, he will do this over and over again. You don’teat anything that is not suitable for Him to eat, do you? Youcannot feed Him non-vegetarian food. But if there is vegetarianfood, you should tell Him, “Thakorji please accept this offeringand have it first.” Can you do this much? Then some dayThakorji will talk to you. He will talk to you the day He ispleased with you. Why would He not? Even these walls will talkto you! It is possible for the whole world to talk to you. If youbathe the Lord everyday with warm water, would He remainsilent forever? If a man gets married and brings home a wife andshe stops talking, then what good is that? What can he do forher if she does not speak? Therefore even the Lord will talk, ifyour inner intention (bhaav) and wishes are so. This worship thatyou are doing is because of your family’s good values.Questioner : When I go out of town I take Thakorjialong with me.Dadashri : You should not perform any action withoutthinking of the Lord. Actually, Thakorji has said not to eat non-vegetarian food, but what can one do? The most He will do isnot speak with you.

That is called being a staunchVaishnav. Those who bathe and care for Thakorji are consideredstaunch Vaishnavs. But what can anyone do? The circumstancesare such that one can be reprimanded nowadays. The idol doesnot talk because of circumstances, otherwise it would.

That verily is the originof attachment; attachment that gives rise to all other attachments.To say, ‘I am Chandulal’ is verily the attachment (raag), andonce this attachment breaks, all others will too. The one whoattains the awareness (laksha), ‘I am a pure Soul’ has brokenall worldly attachments. The one who has the beliefs, ‘I am anacharya (master priest), I am a collector, I am a father’, etc., forhim all attachments remain. These attachments (raag) and theirconsequences are so alive that even the slightest unpleasantwords provoke a severe inner reaction of repulsion (dwesh).One has not understood the message of the vitarag Lord. Theawareness ‘I am Chandulal’ leads to all kinds of attachmentsand the arising of the awareness of, ‘I am Shuddhatma’ is notattachment. It is the awareness that the vitarag Lord too has.The Self, Shuddhatma is vitarag (without attachment) and withthis awareness, all the external relative (the non-self) getswashed off (dissolves).

This mostextraordinary state has been given to you!Questioner : I experience a lot of feelings of attachment(raag) towards my son, what is that?Dadashri : Attachment is not at all an attribute of the SelfAptavani-2225226Aptavani-2(Atma) and yet people say, “My atma (soul) is raagi-dweshi(does attachment and abhorrence).” It appears that way, butreally the subatomic particles (parmanus) within the body getpulled like a magnet when they come across compatibleparmanus. This happens because of the presence of theelectrical body within this body. Then one says, “I am attracted.Attachment (raag) is happening to me.” In all this, the Self is notattracted whatsoever. It is not the property (guna) of the Self tobecome attached. It is vitarag (without any attachment). VitaragLords say that this dancing body complex (putadu) needs to be‘seen’ and ‘known’ as to how it dances; where it is attracted orwhere it is repelled. This is the pure and untainted doctrine of thevitarag Lords and that verily is what ‘we’ are giving you.Liberation will not occur without knowing and being theSelf. A group with the same opinion and agenda (gachha) is anopen fire pit and so is an opinion that does not accept allopinions (mat). Can one afford to jump in such a fire pit? It ispoisonous. The only opinion worth having is the one for theSoul. But instead people are consumed with opinions of, ‘this isours’ and ‘that is yours’, ‘ours’ and ‘yours’. The Lord iscompletely impartial.Attachment and abhorrence is really happening to thetendencies (vrutti) that arise within the worldly soul (I amChandulal). This is in the form of attraction or repulsion.Repulsion (vikarshan, dwesh) results when attraction (akarshan,raag) is obstructed.Questioner : Do attachment and abhorrence existbecause of similarities and differences?Dadashri : It is like a magnet which has poles whichattract and repel. Attachment (raag) is a very different thingaltogether. The attraction people feel towards each other, iswhat they call attachment (raag), but in the language of thevitarag Lords, it is nothing but mere attraction between matchingparmanus. This attraction between parmanus is referred to asraag or attachment; and the repulsion of these parmanus is calleddwesh or abhorrence.From the moment one creates separation of, ‘this is mine’and ‘this is someone else’s’, attachment and abhorrence arisetowards that which is not ‘yours’. When you say it is not mine,it will give rise to abhorrence. When one sees a mosque, he sayshe does not like it. When one sees a temple of Lord Shiva, hewill say, “This is not ours, it is someone else’s.” Abhorrence willremain as long as one says this, and attachment and abhorrencewill cease when one feels that everything is his. When onemoves from the opposite opinion, the opposition ceases. Somelove the stock market, while others hate it. The one withattachment (raag) for the stock market says, “Trading stocks isgood”, and the one with abhorrence will say, “Trading is wrong,this is not a good business.” These are thoughts from two sidesbeing expressed as opinions. Here when one removes oneselffrom the opposite opinions, he ends the opposition.A man abandons his wife and children in search ofliberation. He leaves his money behind and goes into the forestto lead a life of an ascetic but he cannot get rid of hisattachment-abhorrence. What is the obstructive force in all this?Ignorance is the obstructive force. Attachment or abhorrence isnot the obstacle, but ignorance is. Vedanta says that man needsto get rid of mud, vikshep and ignorance. Jains say that oneneeds to get rid of attachment, abhorrence and ignorance.Ignorance is the common factor between the two. Ignorance ofwhat?! The ignorance of the Self. Everything goes once theignorance of the Self goes. But one needs the knower of theSoul (Atma Gnani) to help him get rid of the ignorance (agnan).Wherever there is raag-dwesh, there is the worldly life.Where there is no raag-dwesh, then it does not matter whethera person lives in a palace or a shack, he is free from worldlyattachment (aparigrahi). And even if a person is living in a caveAptavani-2225226Aptavani-2(Atma) and yet people say, “My atma (soul) is raagi-dweshi(does attachment and abhorrence).” It appears that way, butreally the subatomic particles (parmanus) within the body getpulled like a magnet when they come across compatibleparmanus. This happens because of the presence of theelectrical body within this body. Then one says, “I am attracted.Attachment (raag) is happening to me.” In all this, the Self is notattracted whatsoever. It is not the property (guna) of the Self tobecome attached. It is vitarag (without any attachment). VitaragLords say that this dancing body complex (putadu) needs to be‘seen’ and ‘known’ as to how it dances; where it is attracted orwhere it is repelled. This is the pure and untainted doctrine of thevitarag Lords and that verily is what ‘we’ are giving you.Liberation will not occur without knowing and being theSelf. A group with the same opinion and agenda (gachha) is anopen fire pit and so is an opinion that does not accept allopinions (mat). Can one afford to jump in such a fire pit? It ispoisonous. The only opinion worth having is the one for theSoul. But instead people are consumed with opinions of, ‘this isours’ and ‘that is yours’, ‘ours’ and ‘yours’. The Lord iscompletely impartial.Attachment and abhorrence is really happening to thetendencies (vrutti) that arise within the worldly soul (I amChandulal). This is in the form of attraction or repulsion.Repulsion (vikarshan, dwesh) results when attraction (akarshan,raag) is obstructed.Questioner : Do attachment and abhorrence existbecause of similarities and differences?Dadashri : It is like a magnet which has poles whichattract and repel. Attachment (raag) is a very different thingaltogether. The attraction people feel towards each other, iswhat they call attachment (raag), but in the language of thevitarag Lords, it is nothing but mere attraction between matchingparmanus. This attraction between parmanus is referred to asraag or attachment; and the repulsion of these parmanus is calleddwesh or abhorrence.From the moment one creates separation of, ‘this is mine’and ‘this is someone else’s’, attachment and abhorrence arisetowards that which is not ‘yours’. When you say it is not mine,it will give rise to abhorrence. When one sees a mosque, he sayshe does not like it. When one sees a temple of Lord Shiva, hewill say, “This is not ours, it is someone else’s.” Abhorrence willremain as long as one says this, and attachment and abhorrencewill cease when one feels that everything is his. When onemoves from the opposite opinion, the opposition ceases. Somelove the stock market, while others hate it. The one withattachment (raag) for the stock market says, “Trading stocks isgood”, and the one with abhorrence will say, “Trading is wrong,this is not a good business.” These are thoughts from two sidesbeing expressed as opinions. Here when one removes oneselffrom the opposite opinions, he ends the opposition.A man abandons his wife and children in search ofliberation. He leaves his money behind and goes into the forestto lead a life of an ascetic but he cannot get rid of hisattachment-abhorrence. What is the obstructive force in all this?Ignorance is the obstructive force. Attachment or abhorrence isnot the obstacle, but ignorance is. Vedanta says that man needsto get rid of mud, vikshep and ignorance. Jains say that oneneeds to get rid of attachment, abhorrence and ignorance.Ignorance is the common factor between the two. Ignorance ofwhat?! The ignorance of the Self. Everything goes once theignorance of the Self goes. But one needs the knower of theSoul (Atma Gnani) to help him get rid of the ignorance (agnan).Wherever there is raag-dwesh, there is the worldly life.Where there is no raag-dwesh, then it does not matter whethera person lives in a palace or a shack, he is free from worldlyattachment (aparigrahi). And even if a person is living in a caveAptavani-2227228Aptavani-2and you do not see any material possession on him, he is aparigrahi (with worldly attachment) if he has raag-dweshwithin. One becomes a vitarag when raag-dwesh leaves. ‘I amChandulal’ is parigraha (raag, attachment). Raag-dwesh verily isacquisitiveness (parigraha), and non-possession (aparigraha) isthe awareness ‘I am pure Soul’.After you attain this Gnan, there is no raag or dwesh evenwhen you fight with each other that in itself is a wonder! On theother hand, a person who does not have this Gnan has raag-dwesh even when he does not argue or fight. Fighting does notcreate raag-dwesh, but the link (tanto) within that continues, isthe raag-dwesh.Questioner : What is tanto (lingering effects, link),Dada?Dadashri : It is the connection (tant). If you fight withyour wife at night and in the morning when she serves youbreakfast, she bangs your teacup on the table; you willimmediately realize that there is still a connection to thecircumstances of the previous night. That is called tanto. Theone, whose tanto is gone, becomes vitarag. ‘We’ are taking theresponsibility and giving a guarantee of liberation for anyonewho does not harbor any links with anything.There is raag-dwesh where there is ignorance, and thereis vitaragata (non-attachment) where there is Gnan.Questioner : What does it mean when we keepremembering something?Dadashri : When you remember things, it is because ofyour raag-dwesh towards it. If you did not keep remembering,then you would forget whatever entanglements and problemsyou created. Why is it that you don’t remember people youmeet casually, but you remember the close ones who have died?There is a karmic account with them; because there is raag-dwesh there. By doing pratikraman, you will be rid of the‘stickiness’ that binds you. At night you will remember the onestowards whom you have attachment and you will also rememberthe ones for whom you have abhorrence. People haveattachment towards money. People have attachment towards thewife. The only attachment worth having, it is the attachment forthe Gnani. ‘We’ have neither attachment nor abhorrence; ‘we’are completely vitarag.‘I am Chandulal’, is the false location which has occurredbecause of raag-attachment. This means that there is abhorrencetowards the Self (swaroop). What is the principle? When raagexists at one location, then dwesh exists at the other end,because raag and dwesh are two sides of the same coin. Thisis the nature of duality (dwandva). So become a vitarag. AVitarag is beyond all duality (dwandvatita).If you lend hundred thousand rupees, no one will comenear you, but if you owe anything, someone will definitely cometo collect. And what is this debt that you owe? It is a debt ofvengeance. All attachment leads to a debt of vengeance, whichin turn leads to attachment, which leads to vengeance. This verilyis what perpetuates the worldly life. Vitarag Lords knew thatone has to finish the account of suffering of debts and creditsbefore he can be liberated. A person will move towardsliberation only when he realizes that vitarag Lords can giveliberation. You can only find liberation with the vitarag Lords, nowhere else.It should be such that raag does not arise when one ispraised and dwesh does not arise when one is criticized.Compliments (vakhan) or criticism (vakhod) are two sons ofthe same mother, so why differentiate between them? We shouldbe able to give both; we should be able to praise as well ascriticize. We should not keep our mouth shut in either situations;the difference is only in the inner intent (bhaav).

You canfind vitaragata where both praise and criticism are consideredequal. ‘Our’ words may be candid and harsh, but the visionwithin remains the same. The intent (bhaav) is balanced andnon-partial. When praise and criticism appear the same to youon the outside, then the same will be the case on the inside. Onewill have to rise above these dualities. This world has arisenfrom such dualities. Praises and criticisms are dualities. One willhave to rise above these dualities; he will have to become avitarag.Excess of likes and dislikes leads to raag-dweshLike and dislike are two divisions. Like brings pleasureand dislike brings pain. When you like something excessively, itcan turn into dislike. If you like ice cream a lot and they feed youice cream day and night for eight days, what would happen?Questioner : I would get tired of it.Dadashri : Excesses of likes-dislikes result in raag-dwesh but if they remain as likes and dislikes then there is noproblem. Like-dislike is an effect of karmas that are neutral(nokarma), these karmas are light and of no significance; theyare not sticky. They do not hurt anyone. If there is a chair anda mat, even this Gnani Purush will sit on the chair because thatis appropriate and acceptable to everyone, however if someonewere to say to ‘us’, ‘sit over there’, ‘we’ would get up and sitwhere he tells me to. ‘We’ too have likes and dislikes. If youmake ‘us’ sit on the floor, ‘we’ would do so; ‘we’ would makean internal adjustment to ‘like’ sitting on the floor. For us (therelative self) a trace of like-dislike remains from the past, but theSelf does not have any like-dislike. Like-dislike is not an effectof the Self. When you eat vegetables and they are bitter, therewill be an immediate reaction of dislike because the reaction ishappening within the non-self. Wherever there is any like-dislike,it is the entire non-self complex; the Self does not have any like-dislike. ‘Dada’ never has any dislike; from the moment Hewakes up till bedtime, ‘Dada’ is the same. There is only oneinternal state (parinati) that remains constant; ‘Dada’ isconstantly in the eternal bliss of the Self.Speech of attachment-abhorrence is such that a personwill not speak with respect with his own brother but will flatterand welcome his doctor, because of a selfish motive thatsomeday he may need the doctor. My speech is vitaragi; thisvitarag speech is telling you, “Get your work done here, ‘we’ donot need anything from you.” The vitaragi speech tells you to getyour work accomplished. “Come and get your liberation here”,is what it is telling you.That which is shunned through abhorrence willhave to be endured with attachmentYou have not become vitaragi as long as you haveattachment-abhorrence. If a person renounces lemons, hebecomes irate if there is lemon in any of the food that comesbefore him. This means that what he used to like (raag) will haveto be suffered through abhorrence (dwesh). And anythingrenounced through abhorrence will have to be suffered throughattachment. If someone takes a vow not to smoke, and is madeto smoke, he will be resentful that he was made to break hisvow and he will experience internal anger (dwesh). What ismeant by renouncing through raag-dwesh? It means that whenyou renounce with abhorrence something that you like, and thenwhen it comes in front of you, you will like it (raag). That whichis renounced through dwesh-abhorrence, will be sufferedthrough attachment. Most people have renounced that whichthey used to like (raag) and therefore, they have to suffer itthrough abhorrence.Aptavani-2229230Aptavani-2vow not to criticize, then at some point in time you will have tobecome free from that vow too.Where is vitaragata (non-attached interaction)?

Here, in front of the Gnani Purush, if aSthanakvasi (Jain sect) priest were to sit next to a Deravasipriest, even then they would not be able to tolerate each other.Nowadays wherever there are competitors, there is abhorrence.Ordinarily these priests manage to remain detached everywherebut if they learn that there is another person higher than them,then dwesh will arise within. That is why ‘we’ say that one hasto rise above all competition.If two diamond merchants become competitive with eachother, dwesh will arise but they may also develop raag towardseach other, then the two will sit and dine together.What does the Lord consider raag? ‘I am Chandulal’. ‘Iate’, that is raag. ‘I am the mere observer of the one who iseating,’ is not raag. ‘I am Chandulal and this is all mine’, is raag.Attachment towards ignorance is called attachment; and ifyou have attachment for Gnan, then you are a ‘vitarag’.Everyone in the world has misunderstood the meaning ofraag.

People refer to the vitarag Lords as ‘LordParshvanath; the one with the snakes over his head’ or ‘LordMahavir; the one with the lion.’ They are able to distinguish theAptavani-2235236Aptavani-2Ratnagiri mango from the Valsadi mango.

With free time, one encounterskusang. In kusang he squanders away valuable time in uselesstalks and gossips and this creates ‘stains’ (paap). All the miseryin the world is because of these ‘stains’. What right does onehave to talk about anyone else? He has to look after his ownaffairs. Whether another person is happy or unhappy, what doesit have to do with you? But here one even gossips about theking. He talks about things that have absolutely nothing to dowith him and this creates abhorrence and jealousy, and these arethe very causes of his misery.

In reality, you are vitarag, so why harbor raag-dwesh?There is nothing but raag-dwesh if you become one with thename, the relative self, the non-self, and if you become onewill you gain anything when you are in search for peace? No. Soyou have to ask the shopkeeper from the very beginning andmake sure that you are in the right place. Tell bapji (the guru),“I am willing to spend six months to a year with you if you tellme to and if I can attain moksha; but only if I attain liberationand only if all my worries will cease. Otherwise I will searchelsewhere.” For countless past lives all you have done is makepayments to such shopkeepers and still you have not attainedmoksha. So tell bapji, “I will pay my dues if you are able togrant me moksha.” Just test bapji a little in this way! If he getsangry, you will have your answer right away. You will knowimmediately that this is definitely not the shop for liberation.Despite this make bapji happy, spend a couple of hundredrupees for him, and be thankful that you are getting away bydoing only that much.What is the purpose of satsang?

When youmeet a Gnani Purush, quickly come out of the pond you are in.If you find a Gnani Purush, you will become the owner of everypond there is and your work will be done. The Gnani will bringyou beyond all the ponds.By being in the Gnani’s satsang, you become permeatedwith the Gnani’s paas (aroma; paas - the effect of contact orcompany). The paas of asafetida (hinga; the acrid smelling resinused in cooking); becomes so entrenched in the cooking potsthat even if you cook rice pudding in it six months later, it ruinsthe rice pudding. When even the effect of asafetida lasts for sixmonths, it is possible for the effect of kusang to destroy one’scountless lives to come. In the same token, the effect of satsangis equally strong but the time spent in satsang must increase.“Hey! We have to do this in order to run our worldly life.”If just one word of this statement were to enter within (becomesyour belief), you are doomed. It ruins your sanskar (samskar;inner substrate which is a net effect of all that is positive that youhave attained from past lives). There is no telling when one willbe led in the wrong direction. Only Gnan can prevent yoursanskar from becoming ruined.For example, a sant purush (one who helps others movefrom the bad to the good and lives his life accordingly) makeshis living selling milk. He meets someone who tells him, “Justlook at your neighbor, he has made so much money and lookat you, you have remained the same, poor.” The saint asks him,“How did he make so much money?” The other man replies,“By mixing water in his milk, of course!” Now if just a singleword of this statement were to penetrate the saint’s mind, thatwould be the end of him. Just one word will wash away all hiscurrent spiritual stock.People will drag one into sensual pleasures even when hedoes not wish to. This is the fault of the company. There will beno problem if he is in good company. He will find a rose withgood company and encounter thorns with bad company. Ifsomeone forces you to drink alcohol, you will have to make abig excuse or object strongly against it. Tell him that your doctorhas absolutely forbidden alcohol or that your wife will not let youback in the house. One way or another you will have tooverpower the situation. As far as kusang is concerned it is bestto keep your distance.How clever and shrewd the vitarag Lords must have beento attain liberation through understanding! Those who cannotbear the burning heat of worldly suffering have immersedthemselves in the ‘sticky mud’ which has a temporary coolingeffect (immersion in worldly vices). But the Lord has said, “It isbetter to become strong through the heat of the suffering. Youare doomed once you fall into the mud!” The one who sufferswill eventually cool down, but when will the one immersed inmud become free? Once you enter the sticky mud, you willinherit a warehouse of kashays (anger, pride, deceit and greed),but if you undergo penance of the burning heat of suffering, atleast your kashays will become less. If you keep the companyof the one who is immersed in the worldly mud (kusang), evenwhen you do not have many kashays yourself, the otherperson’s kashays (negativities) will influence you and take holdwithin. You must do a lot of pratikraman if you fall into the mudeven once, and make a firm determination that you will not fallagain. But if you fall into the company of ignorant people whoverily are laden with kashays, how can you escape without beingscathed with kashays, yourself?A satsang that beats you all the time is still preferable overAptavani-2243244Aptavani-2without name (anami), the Self, then you become a vitarag.The Lord has said, “Until you meet a Gnani Purush,remain in whichever pond (one’s beliefs, sects and relativereligion) you are in, don’t go around looking for another pond.”You may become stuck in the mud if you try to swim in otherponds and that mud will leave you covered in stains.

The Gnani will bringyou beyond all the ponds.By being in the Gnani’s satsang, you become permeatedwith the Gnani’s paas (aroma; paas - the effect of contact orcompany). The paas of asafetida (hinga; the acrid smelling resinused in cooking); becomes so entrenched in the cooking potsthat even if you cook rice pudding in it six months later, it ruinsthe rice pudding. When even the effect of asafetida lasts for sixmonths, it is possible for the effect of kusang to destroy one’scountless lives to come. In the same token, the effect of satsangis equally strong but the time spent in satsang must increase.“Hey! We have to do this in order to run our worldly life.”If just one word of this statement were to enter within (becomesyour belief), you are doomed. It ruins your sanskar (samskar;inner substrate which is a net effect of all that is positive that youhave attained from past lives). There is no telling when one willbe led in the wrong direction. Only Gnan can prevent yoursanskar from becoming ruined.For example, a sant purush (one who helps others movefrom the bad to the good and lives his life accordingly) makeshis living selling milk. He meets someone who tells him, “Justlook at your neighbor, he has made so much money and lookat you, you have remained the same, poor.” The saint asks him,“How did he make so much money?” The other man replies,“By mixing water in his milk, of course!” Now if just a singleword of this statement were to penetrate the saint’s mind, thatwould be the end of him. Just one word will wash away all hiscurrent spiritual stock.People will drag one into sensual pleasures even when hedoes not wish to. This is the fault of the company. There will beno problem if he is in good company. He will find a rose withgood company and encounter thorns with bad company. Ifsomeone forces you to drink alcohol, you will have to make abig excuse or object strongly against it. Tell him that your doctorhas absolutely forbidden alcohol or that your wife will not let youback in the house. One way or another you will have tooverpower the situation. As far as kusang is concerned it is bestto keep your distance.How clever and shrewd the vitarag Lords must have beento attain liberation through understanding! Those who cannotbear the burning heat of worldly suffering have immersedthemselves in the ‘sticky mud’ which has a temporary coolingeffect (immersion in worldly vices). But the Lord has said, “It isbetter to become strong through the heat of the suffering. Youare doomed once you fall into the mud!” The one who sufferswill eventually cool down, but when will the one immersed inmud become free? Once you enter the sticky mud, you willinherit a warehouse of kashays (anger, pride, deceit and greed),but if you undergo penance of the burning heat of suffering, atleast your kashays will become less. If you keep the companyof the one who is immersed in the worldly mud (kusang), evenwhen you do not have many kashays yourself, the otherperson’s kashays (negativities) will influence you and take holdwithin. You must do a lot of pratikraman if you fall into the mudeven once, and make a firm determination that you will not fallagain. But if you fall into the company of ignorant people whoverily are laden with kashays, how can you escape without beingscathed with kashays, yourself?A satsang that beats you all the time is still preferable overAptavani-2245246Aptavani-2the kusang that feeds you delicacies. Just an hour of kusang willdestroy the effect of satsang of countless lives. It takes twenty-five years or so to grow trees in the jungles, but how long doesit take to destroy the trees if there is a fire in the jungle? Howmuch can the Gnani Purush do? He will carefully plant youngsaplings in the jungle everyday and he will nurture them. He willfeed the saplings the water of satsang. But how long will it takefor the fire of kusang to destroy the saplings? The highest punyais the one that will not let one encounter kusang. Do people inkusang demand that you keep affection (bhaav) for them? Yourdealings with them should be superficial. Keep them at a ‘hello’level (from afar; from a distance). The company of the ones whohave attained Akram Vignan will lead you to final liberation(keval Gnan).Satsang of the manifest GnaniIn the satsang of this ‘Dada’, you are bestowed with thesang (company) of the pure Soul; it is the ultimate sang. Nothingbut the absolute Gnan (keval Gnan) is what you are given here,but the influence of the current era of this time cycle is such, thatit does not let this Gnan fully manifest; it does not let this Gnanattain completion to 360 degrees that is Keval Gnan.‘We’ have with ‘us’ the exactness of all ‘we’ have seenin this Gnan. You should ask the Gnani Purush whatever youhave to, when you are blessed with the opportunity to meetHim. What a tremendous loss it is if you do not take advantageof that opportunity to get your work done! Gnani Purush is theone for whom nothing more needs to be known.Satsang means to gather in order to observe the Gnani’svyavahar i.e. the Gnani’s worldly interaction.Questioner : Should we do bhakti (rituals of worship) inorder to attain liberation?Dadashri : When bhakti is done with the ultimate goal ofattaining the Soul, you will attain the instruments i.e. the Gnani.Doing satsang with anyone who harbors even the slightestworldly desire will be useless if you want liberation. Such asatsang will be helpful if you want to be born in the celestialworld. For liberation, you will need the satsang of the one whois absolutely free of all desires.You should tell vyavasthit, “Give me time for satsang”,then vyavasthit will bring about such circumstances, but if youdon’t ask, it will not.There is an ocean of infinite bliss within you, but you arecaught up in a frenzy of grabbing temporary pleasures, and thattoo with deceit.One way or another, the only thing worth doing is toremain in the satsang or otherwise stay at home. It is notadvisable to touch kusang even for a moment; it is poison.Your efforts should not be in vain; you should not wasteyour days. Make time to avail yourself to only satsang. If youare absorbed with ‘this’ satsang, then your work is done. Thewhole world is absorbed in kusang. One complains that he is notable to go to the temple, upashraya (gathering of ascetics) orvyakhyan (spiritual lectures); he even gets angry and says thathe is not able to go even when he wants to. What is the reasonfor this? The answer is that he is immersed in kusang and thatis why he is not able to go. And here for us all, we are filled withonly satsang and the whole world is forgotten! Everything in lifeis mandatory, but there is no one with greater punya whensatsang becomes mandatory for him! In addition, this satsang isbeyond all that is the non-Self (alaukik). It is the real satsang.Elsewhere in the world there is nothing but mandatory kusang.Now satsang has become mandatory for you and that too sittingin the comforts of your own home!There is tremendous danger if you vacillate (employAptavani-2245246Aptavani-2the kusang that feeds you delicacies.

Outside the spiritualknowledge given is stale. The Lord has said, “Wherever thereis a Tirthankara or a Gnani, the knowledge is fresh.” All spiritualknowledge is definitely stale in the absence of these two. Whena person has a slightest desire for worldly things, his spiritualknowledge is considered stale. When such a person givesdiscourse, there is a desire for fame. People have to rely on suchknowledge in the absence of a Gnani, which means they have totake support of this stale knowledge. But when a Gnani isaround, the support of knowledge that is pure and free from allworldly desires is available and that brings forth moksha.

You shouldunderstand Gnan from point to point, gradually. The easiest waybesides satsang, is to keep ‘Dada’ happy. This is done byfollowing his five Agnas (spiritual directives given by Dadashri toall who acquired Self-realization).If one cannot get ‘our’ company (sang) then the companyof ‘our’ words is satsang too. Satsang means the company ofthe Self (Shuddhatma). Alternatively, anything that promotes thiscompany, like the words of the Gnani Purush, and Self-realizedmahatmas is also satsang. It is not worth keeping the companyof anyone else, regardless of whatever that person is, whetherhe is an ascetic, a monk or anyone else. All you have to do isto ‘see’ (darshan) what is within (the Self); nothing else is worthsetting eyes on. Once you have attained the Self, ‘see’ the Selfin every living being.

Trimantra lightens the intensity and effect ofkarmas; heavy karmas become light. The recitation of themantra itself is one of the evidences; it is a part of the totalspectrum. It too is one of the many evidences that come intoplay. The Gnani is a nimit (instrumental in the process), but youwould only encounter a nimit if the changes were meant to takeplace. Karma will not spare anyone; only if the obstacles weremeant to be destroyed will one come across a nimit and themantra has the power to allay the obstacles.The Brahmin priest looks at all the horoscopes beforearriving at an auspicious time for a marriage of a young woman.If certain timing of the wedding forecasts a death, he will changethe time, but despite this if the bride was meant to become awidow, she will. How can anyone make changes in that? Aslong as a person is aware, he can exercise caution, but what ifhe has no awareness? Such is the worldly life.You are a Jain so you must be reciting the NavkarMantra, right?Questioner : Yes, I recite it everyday.Dadashri : Then you must not be having any externaldifficulties, do you?Questioner : Difficulties are inevitable in the worldly life.Dadashri : Who passes the sentence of judgment, theJudge or his clerk?Questioner : The Judge.Dadashri : Navkar Mantra too needs to be given by a‘Judge’. Do you recite the Navkar mantra with an understandingor without it? How can you buy ghee if you do not know whatit is? Then the shopkeeper will sell you something elsealtogether. Mantra given by a Gnani Purush will give exactresults. If one recites the Trimantra as given by ‘us’, his worldlyobstacles will be removed; he will remain in dharma and it is alsopossible for him to attain moksha.Reciting the mantra, ‘Sarva Sadhubhyam Namah’ (Ibow to all the sadhus) or the Navkar Mantra does not reach theright target. Today, Navkar (the Panch Parmeshtis) do not existhere. Today the ones who become Self realized through ‘our’Gnan fall in the category of Navkar. Otherwise, the obeisancein the Navkar reaches other universes. That is why the NavkarMantra has to be recited. The Navkar Mantra you recite doesnot reach these (worldly) acharyas because they believe, ‘I aman acharya.’Questioner : If I recite the Navkar Mantra in my mind,does it automatically reach the Panch Parmeshti Bhagwants?Dadashri : Navkar Mantra is such that it will reach towhomever you desire to pay obeisance to.So many people recite the Navkar Mantra and yet theyAptavani-2253254Aptavani-2Siddhanum’, means I do obeisance to the Siddha Lords whohave attained final moksha. There is no difference between theArihant and Siddha except that the Arihants have a physicalbody whereas the Siddha Lords are without a body. The thirdobeisance is to the Acharyas who have completed and haveabsolute knowledge of the Soul and give others the sameknowledge. Then comes upadhyaya; those who have attainedthe knowledge of the Soul but are in the process of studying tobecome absolute. They also teach and guide others to do thesame. The obeisance ‘Namo Loye savvasahunum’ addresses allthe sadhus; sages of all the different religions. We are not talkingabout those who are dressed in saffron or white clothing. Weare talking about only those who are in pursuit of the Soul; allothers cannot be considered sadhus.

No one recites the trueNavkar Mantra! The persons you seek to address with yourNavkar Mantra are not deserving of that message, and the letteryou are sending is not really meant for them. If you mail a letterto the wrong address, it will be forwarded to the office of ‘deadletters’, and so your letter has been in vain and hence yourworries still remain intact. You have to decide, ‘may my Navkarreach the real sadhus, the real acharya and the real upadhyayawherever they reside on this planet and in this universe.’ YourNavkar needs to reach these three categories of people for sure.It automatically reaches the Siddhas and the Arihants.Questioner : Do you mean that the Navkar reachesautomatically?Dadashri : Yes, it reaches automatically. Now when yousay Namo Arihantanum, you know that there is no Arihant Lordon this planet of ours, so it reaches the Arihants wherever theyare, and Namo Siddhanum reaches the Siddha Lords, but itreaches with the same intent with which you recite it.You will have to understand all this. The meaning of theJain religion is to understand everything and to sing about it,having understood everything. Narsinh Mehta was a poet wholived in a subdivision amongst other Nagar (Brahmin) people.Every morning he would get up early and sing devotional songs.People would make fun of him; they would mimic his singing asthey brushed their teeth. One could hear the entire subdivisionmimicking him. That is why Narsinh said:‘Maru gayoon je gaashey tey ghana goda khaashey, neysamjii ne gaashey, to vaikunth jaashey.’‘Those who sing whatever I sing will take a beatingAnd those who sing having attained the understanding willgo to Vaikunth – the heavenly abode of Lord Vishnu.’Don’t try to imitate me, because you will suffer if you do.In the same token, recite this Navkar Mantra afterunderstanding it. Where does this Mantra reach? To whom doesit reach? Understand that first and then send your mantra.Whom does the Lord call a sadhu? It is the one who hasattained the Self and is proceeding on the path to become theSupreme Self. Such a one is a sadhu. Others are not realsadhus. They are wrong sadhus (kusadhus). Those who pointout any paths, other than that of the vitarag Lords, have beencalled sectarians. What can you possibly get from these people?We just have to accept what Lord Mahavir told us as the truth.We should recite, ‘Namo Vitragaya.’Understand this Navkar mantra and then recite it. Thisuniverse is very big and collectively there are twenty livingTirthankaras at the moment. If you recite the Navkar mantraafter correctly understanding it, then even if you do not have theknowledge of the Self, you will reap the benefit of Om ((cid:67)); thebenefit of paying obeisance to all Panch Parmeshtis, i.e. startingfrom those who have attained the Self to those who haveattained moksha (final liberation). You will reap the benefit ofOm ((cid:67)) if you recite the mantra after understanding who thePanch Parmeshtis are and who the Tirthankaras are.Exact understanding of Om ((cid:67))Questioner : Dada, what is Om ((cid:67))?Dadashri : Om is to recite the Navkar mantra with afocused concentration (ekagrata). To recite the Navkar Mantrawith the awareness of ‘I am pure Soul’ is Om kar bindusanyuktam.‘Om kar bindu sanyuktam, nityam dyayanti yoginahKaamdum mokshadum chaiva, Omkar namo namah.’‘The constant meditation on the full Omkar Mantra by theyogi leads to worldly as well as spiritual prosperity.

Even by simply reciting ‘Om’ it reachesthe Panch Parmeshti and even when you recite the NavkarMantra it reaches the Panch Parmeshti Bhagwans. ‘We’ havekept the three mantras together in order to get rid of all enmityin the heart of humans. This is so because the state of trueimpartiality arises after only one becomes a pure Soul. Theawareness of ‘I am a pure Soul’ is same as the Omkar binduSanyuktam. And liberation is the end result of this awareness.Elsewhere, wherever they practice the Omkar, doing so is anecessity for them. Because as long as the real truth has notbeen attained, one has to take the support of something that istangible. From the subtle perspective, the Gnani Purush isconsidered Om. Om includes anyone that has attained theknowledge of the Self to anyone who has become the absoluteSelf; they are all called Om. Beyond that comes liberation.When is liberation attained? Only when one becomes Omkarbindu sanyuktam. Here when ‘we’ give you the Self, Youbecome Omkar bindu sanyuktam, and once You become that,You will attain liberation. No one in the world can prevent orhinder Your liberation once this happens.The Navkar Mantra is considered sanyast mantra - amantra for those who have renounced. As long as one isinvolved in the worldly life, he should recite all the three mantrastogether; the Navkar Mantra, (cid:67) Namo Bhagavate Vasudevayaand (cid:67) Namah Shivaya.

No. In the same manner,such were the people during the time of the Lord and that is whyHe used the word illusion (bhranti) and did not go beyond that.And yet there are some cows that will not budge even if youapproach them with a stick.

Why do they want peace? Theywant peace in order to reduce their ‘mental’ state. But the worrycontinues despite eating food prepared at home. They wear nicepants and keep fussing over their clothes, as if someone has thetime to watch them. No one has the time! Everyone is engulfedin their own worries so much so that they cannot see even whentheir eyes are open. No one has the time to look at you evenif you were to go out in torn clothes. You see people in Bombaywalking around fussing with their clothes. Bombay, the citywhere the roads are so smooth, that they shine. During the timeof Lord Mahavir, people had to walk so much.

If youwant to have an underhand then, someone is bound to becomeyour boss, surely!The world today has become like a hospital for the mad.There is no telling when people will change their opinions aboutyou. One minute they say ‘you are very wise’ and the next theywill accuse you of being mad. There is no telling what kind ofa ‘certificate’ they will award you. Why must we be afraid of thecertificates that such ‘mental’ people give us? There is no tellingwhat they will say to you. If the sane were to go live amongstthe insane, they would not be able to do so. Today everyone ismad and these animals are sane.Today do we ever see anyone that inspires us to want tospend a year with him? Alas the human beings of this era of thecurrent time cycle are rejected goods from the past four eras ofthe time cycle; they are enough to make you nauseous! How cana relationship be fostered with such people? You yourself aregarbage and so is the other person!Today if you were to receive a message, you don’t get thecorrect message even if it is given firsthand. You ask somethingand you get a totally different answer. Everything has becomevery peculiar.People were very gentle during the time of the Lord andthat is why He had to speak very carefully to them. If there isa herd of cows and you yell at them and they run away, will yoube able to say anything more to them? No. In the same manner,such were the people during the time of the Lord and that is whyHe used the word illusion (bhranti) and did not go beyond that.And yet there are some cows that will not budge even if youapproach them with a stick. Then we have to call the cowmental (crazy) as well. And people too are mental, are they not?They eat food made at home and clothes that belong to themand yet they worry! They get wonderful food to eat, they wearbeautiful cloths and still they worry. Why do they eat homemadefood? They do that so that antahkaran (their mind, intellect, chitand ego) may be at peace. Why do they want peace? Theywant peace in order to reduce their ‘mental’ state. But the worrycontinues despite eating food prepared at home. They wear nicepants and keep fussing over their clothes, as if someone has thetime to watch them. No one has the time! Everyone is engulfedin their own worries so much so that they cannot see even whentheir eyes are open. No one has the time to look at you evenif you were to go out in torn clothes. You see people in Bombaywalking around fussing with their clothes. Bombay, the citywhere the roads are so smooth, that they shine. During the timeof Lord Mahavir, people had to walk so much. Today there isso much luxury and yet people do not know how to enjoy it. Noone has the time to look at you even if you go around in saffronclothing in Bombay. Even your friend will not give you anyAptavani-2263264Aptavani-2importance because he thinks you are not what you pretend to be.India – A center of the world in 2005Why has India become a mental hospital? It is becausethe land and people of the Sanskrit language have been taughtnothing but vikrut; meaning that which is deformed and broken.It would be acceptable for these people to have somethingordinary or common, but they cannot be made vikrut. Becausetheir language has turned vikrut, it has created a mental hospital.Nevertheless all these ‘mental patients’ in the hospital will givebirth to children who will be wise; truly wise. So it is fine forthese mental ones to live. Their children will have wisdom; thechildren may grow long hair and they may do strange things butultimately their wisdom will shine.Around about the year 2005, India will become a centerfor the world. People from all over the world will come to learnfrom the children of these mental people as to how to live life.They will come to ask these children how and what they shouldeat and what they should study. What has been the benefit ofpeople becoming mental? The answer to that is that whateverdevelopment there was previously, has now been abolished, ithas been ‘washed out’, and everything has become good, thischange is positive. The sanskar of the past had rotted away andthere was nothing left.Contempt has invited degradationQuestioner : When I look at my mother and my grand-daughter, I see such a great difference between the two. Thegeneration of today has become ruined.Dadashri : And during the time of your grandfather, whatwas your grandfather saying about you?Questioner : He used to say the same thing as I just did.Dadashri : You bring home a nice looking squash. Now,since it is meant to be cooked, will you not have to cut it? Youcannot say don’t cut it because it looks too good to eat. If youwant to cook it you will have to let go of its ‘good looks’. Indiacurrently is developing, as it has never done before. Mostlyeveryone’s conduct has degraded and consequently only abouttwo or five percent of people have conduct that has any worth.Otherwise everyone is consumed with doubts, uncertainty,bickering and contempt. They are contemptuous towards thelower cast people, towards other people, towards their ownfamily. There is contempt towards disciples who appear to fallshort in their prescribed conduct; everywhere you look, there iscontempt. This land had become spoiled. The improvement yousee in the current generation is helping to reduce the uncivilizedqualities of the earlier generation. Whatever rudeness they hadhas diminished and they have begun to develop a different kindof rudeness. People of the past did not like this. In the daysgone by there was nothing but contempt. The condition of Indiahad become very unruly and uncivilized; this is because peoplehad not thought things through. This state of India could not becalled devout or religious. The entire lot was not looked after ornurtured properly and hence the chaos. The current generationis now being nurtured and cared for.The current generation may appear ‘this way’ but reallythey are in the process of being cultured. This is always the case;the pendulum always swings too far before a reform. Nowadaysif children go out and enjoy themselves, parents do not ostracizethem, as did the parents of the past. Today the parents will nothave too much aversion towards their children dining out inrestaurants and enjoying themselves outside the home. But in thepast they used to react with intense disgust and scorn. ‘We’ askyou what problems you have with restaurants that you behavein this manner. What kind of people are these? Had the Lordsaid for people to become depressed in this manner? What arethe teachings of the vitarag Lord?

The Lord has said thatAptavani-2265266Aptavani-2anything above normal is poison and below normal is poison.People had become ‘above normal’ and gone to the extreme inevery manner and consequently there was no limit to the evil intheir conduct. The wickedness in people’s conduct today ismuch better than that compared to that of the past; their vice isopen and exposed. Today, they openly support naked dancing.In the past all the vices were covert and hidden. The wholecountry had become just like that and that is why we have somuch suffering today. This land has taken a terrible suffering.Even when a woman becomes a widow, people lookupon her with contempt to no end. Not even uncivilized peoplewould do so; they would look upon her with compassion thatshe has lost her support. People should understand that the poorwoman is suffering because she has no one to depend on.People should have compassion for her because her happinesscame from her husband. But alas they bombard contempt evenupon a widow. Nowhere else in the world can you find the kindof contempt they have for the ‘untouchables’. Everywhere thereis nothing but terrible contempt; how can you call this a civilizedcountry?When I was young the older folks used to say that theyounger generation has become bad. I in turn would questionthem about what their grandparents used to say about themwhen they were young. This is a kind of wildness; this wildnesshas continued from time immemorial. They claim we should doexactly as they did. ‘You have to jump into the same well as wedid’, is what they say. You argue with them and tell them thereis no longer any water in that well, there is only large rocks andsnakes and that you will die if you were to jump into it now.There used to be water in the well before, but they are tellingyou to jump in the very same well now. They tell you to fall inonly the Vaishnav’s well or the Jain’s well. For goodness sake,for how long can we continue to jump into such wells? Theyinsist that we do the same as they did. For heavens sake, we tellthem, we do not see any radiance on your faces and you donothing but kashays all day long. And when they go to eat atsomeone’s house, all they think about is they got a free meal.When these ‘developed’ people of India dine at someone else’shome, the knowledge that presents to them is, ‘Today I amgetting a free meal so I should fill myself up!’ Such are the socalled developed elderly of India. And some of these peoplewould starve themselves for a day or two before their day of thedinner invitation so that they would not use up their own foodat home and when they eat at other people’s home, they wouldeat enough to last them for two more days! All they areconcerned with is getting the most out of a free meal. Justimagine how all they are concerned with is getting the most outof a free meal. Just imagine the thieving tendencies they harbor.They invariably suffer the consequences of these very tendenciesand actions. The contempt these older people had towardswidowed women has come to haunt them. These very widowedwomen, who were abused, have come as their divorceddaughters who come home. These very daughters have broughttremendous misery to their fathers. These very widows havecome back as their daughters for repayment. Why do thesewomen not come to my home and harass me? It is because Iwas not like these people.A widowed woman is to be called ‘Gangaswarup’ (tobe revered as the holy Ganges). How can one ever disrespecther? They address these women as, ‘Gangaswarup’, and yet ifthey happen to come across path with a widow, they curse herand say, “I am going to have bad luck. I was on my way to avery important job, but now I will have bad luck.” Such wildand uncivilized people! Such people should be hung by theirnecks! But the Lord has said, “You should not hang them.

I will not have any objection to your asking.Ask for advice.” Ordinarily, we consult a lawyer for advice sowhy would a father be any lesser? Surely one has more trust ina father than a lawyer?India had not improved. It was not worth thinking about.It had become poisonous. Just look at the pitiful state of thiscountry! However, no one is to blame. Really no human beingis at fault. The natural evidences come together, which bringsforth circumstances. Now a change is taking place here.Today in this world, India is reaching new heights ofdevelopment. It has reached a pinnacle. How else can there betalks about moksha? Moksha is never meant to be written aboutand no one has the right to write the word moksha either. Withthe exception of a very few, all preceptors, priests and asceticshave become over-wise.

Only theGnani Purush can turn that energy around and make it usefulagain. How did this energy come to be wasted? ‘This man isworking towards an I.A.S. (coveted rank of Indian AdministrativeService) degree, so I will do the same.’ This is how the energyis dissipated, in trying to imitate others. Just for a maintenancejob, tremendous energy has been lost and that too throughcreating tremendous kashaya. Whatever wealth of inner energiesone has is completely depleted when one tries to imitate others.Do not take away from the balance of inner happiness andharmony.

But no,these people would beat the rider to the point of killing him!How can you call these people civilized? If you have apiece of pure gold and imitation gold, the imitation gold does nothave any of the properties of pure gold, so of what value is it?The one born on this land of India has infinite inner energies, butthat energy has been scattered and wasted away. Only theGnani Purush can turn that energy around and make it usefulagain. How did this energy come to be wasted? ‘This man isworking towards an I.A.S. (coveted rank of Indian AdministrativeService) degree, so I will do the same.’ This is how the energyis dissipated, in trying to imitate others. Just for a maintenancejob, tremendous energy has been lost and that too throughcreating tremendous kashaya. Whatever wealth of inner energiesone has is completely depleted when one tries to imitate others.Do not take away from the balance of inner happiness andharmony.

It has become puzzled onits own. So how is anyone going to assess it? People keep tryingto measure and evaluate this puzzle. They make conclusions thatare based on the population of the world in 1974, in the year2000 it will be so much. You foolish people! If a couple had onechild the first year and another one in their third year, are theygoing to have thirty to forty kids by the time they become eightyyears old? How can one make such deductions? Let go of thesefoolish notions. Don’t try to make any assessment about thepopulation or about human growth. It is sheer foolishness to dothis.

If you know the arithmeticof such calculation, then tell me what the population was 5000years ago. Then they’ll say, “We don’t know.” What nonsense!What kind of a man are you? You don’t even know how tobehave as a husband! Why don’t you stop reproducing if youare so concerned about the population? You foolish people!What audacity of trying to predict population growth; it will bethis much in 1980, this much in 1990 and this much in 2000.And yet there is no one to lock up these people! On thecontrary, the government accepts their theories. Anyone whotalks such nonsense should be locked up. Why must they talkthis way? It ruins the public.India will not fall into ruins. How can a land where thereis a presence of a sant purush, a sat purush and a Gnani Purush,fall into ruins? Wherever there is a presence of these three,nothing will spoil. On the contrary whatever has deteriorated willbegin to improve. India had deteriorated to terrifying limits.Nowhere else in the world did a country deteriorate to theextent that India has.

If you give a small child a piece ofglass and a diamond, the child will keep the glass and his fatherwill take the diamond because of his intellect (buddhi). Theintellect will procure you worldly gains.As far as the worldly life is concerned, the correct use ofintellect is to differentiate between what is beneficial and what isnot; it is to be used to make decisions that would help one dothe job properly and to avoid being reprimanded by superiorsat work. Or to take out a bug that lands in dinner plate. The useof intellect is to be limited to these types of situations and reallythe intellect spontaneously surfaces when the situation calls for it.But what happens when the intellect keeps interfering day andnight? Whether someone tells ‘us’, “Dada you have no sense”or “Dada you are a Gnani Purush”, both the circumstances arethe same for ‘us’. They appear the same to ‘us’ because ‘we’are without intellect (abuddha). The intellect will say, ‘I like thecomment, ‘Dada you are a Gnani Purush’ and ‘I don’t like thecomment, ‘Dada you have not sense’. ‘We’ have becomewithout intellect (abuddha) from the very beginning. These aremere circumstances, circumstances which sometimes say, “Dadayou are a Gnani Purush” and sometimes, “Dada you have nosense.” Furthermore, it is all vyavasthit. Vyavasthit will notpardon you from any circumstances. And if you use yourintellect, you will not escape being hurt from either the pleasantor the unpleasant circumstance. So let them speak, what havewe to lose? If someone speaks that way, you have to say,“Record, keep playing; we are listening to you!” Whatever isbeing said is a record that has been previously taped and itcannot change under any circumstances.

But he likes comfortable situationsand dislikes uncomfortable ones. In an inconvenient circumstancehe will say, “Why has this person come to have tea here?” andif the circumstance is convenient he will force the visitor to havetea even if the visitor has no desire to drink it. What is the rootcause behind this? Why does he say this is good and this is bad?It is because of the illusion (mithya drashti); he has the wrongperspective. People have absolutely no awareness of what isright and what is wrong because of this illusion.In this world, there is only the Self and the sanyog(circumstance).

Let me explain how.There is a diamond which gives out white light; the reflected lightwhich comes out of it looks white. Now if we place a piece ofred cloth underneath it, the diamond would appear red and ifyou put green cloth under it, it would appear green. The Soul isjust like the diamond; it reflects whatever circumstances comebefore it. If anger arises within, it becomes ‘hot’ but in reality theSelf is pure (Shuddhatma) and is never affected, colored ortainted. When oil and water are mixed, the two never becomeone even when stirred endlessly. In the way the Self isimmiscible. In the countless past lives, the Soul has never beencut, it has never been squashed – whether it has taken a formof a snake or a cat, whatever form it has been present in, theSelf has not been spoilt even in the least; only the physical formhas changed.Some prefer the daytime and some the nighttime but bothare circumstances and both are relative. Because there is nightthere is value for the day and because of the daytime there isvalue of the night.The vitarag Lords say, “These are all circumstances andthe other is the Self, there is no third one besides these two.”Also there is no such thing as good, bad, right or wrong.Vyavasthit says, “No one has any control to change anycircumstances. It is merely and only an account from the past.”The vitarag Lords say all circumstances are the same. Whethersomething comes to you or is taken away from you, it is all thesame. But this is where the intellect interferes. You only have toremain as the knower and the seer of all circumstances. All thesecircumstances have a natural end. When the circumstance ofcoming together (sanyog) ends, the circumstance of dissipation(viyog) begins and it will come to its natural end.The nature of all sanyog is that all will come to a definiteend (viyog). Any circumstance that arises will dissipate when thetime comes. Even if you want it to stay, it will not. When the timecomes, all circumstances will dissipate but during unpleasantcircumstances, people become impatient, ‘He is still here? Whenwill he go?’ and two minutes will seem like ten minutes. Waitingmakes time go slower. All circumstances definitely have an end.The Self must not get involved in any circumstance(sanyog); the Self is simply the knower and observer of it. Weshould neither fight with circumstances nor should we sit withthem. Whatever comes your way, all you have to say is ‘Go toDada’. Every circumstance is constantly changing and the Self iscompletely separate from the circumstance. Thoughts that springforth are circumstances, it is an illusion to become one with themand get carried away with them. All you have to do is simplyknow the thoughts.If ever a circumstance of fear arises for a person, he willwithdraw into ‘cave’ of the Self and will thus have theexperience of the Self. A little child would not part with his toysand if you try to take them away, he will throw a fit. But if hesees a cat comes, he will leave everything behind and run awayin fear.

A little child would not part with his toysand if you try to take them away, he will throw a fit. But if hesees a cat comes, he will leave everything behind and run awayin fear. If a person who has attained the Self has to face aterrifying circumstance, he will have the complete experience ofAptavani-2281282Aptavani-2the Self. All of us have to face circumstances; we should havepreference for circumstances that help us progress towards theSelf, we should not have preference for circumstances that helpus in the relative world. Worldly people make two distinctionsin all circumstances, a profitable (beneficial) circumstance or acircumstance of loss (non-beneficial circumstance). But weknow that profit and loss is not in our control. The circumstancethat brings us satsang is the circumstance that is worth choosing.All other circumstances are merely just that, circumstances. Andthe biggest circumstance of all, the one that always sleeps withyou at night and stays with you during the day, the circumstanceof the mind, speech and body are the very circumstances thathas brought you suffering, so what other circumstances will bringyou happiness? This circumstance of the mind, speech and bodyis not likely to leave you and there you have to do sambhavenikal; you have to deal with it, with equanimity.It is like this, the more difficult the circumstance, the morethis Gnan will flourish. Nevertheless one does not have to go outlooking for difficult circumstances either; just deal with them asthey come, with equanimity.Bitter circumstances can be made sweetDadashri : How is your mother’s health?Questioner : Ordinarily her health is good but yesterdayshe fell in the bathroom; she is getting old now.Dadashri : The rule of circumstances is that one weakcircumstance will pull together many other weak circumstancesand one strong circumstance will pull together many other strongcircumstances. Old age is a circumstance of weakness that iswhy one meets with other circumstances of weakness. To theone who is weak and feeble will come circumstances ofweakness. We have no choice but somehow deal withcircumstances in any way that we can. People of this world willbully a weakling. The Lord has said that whenever you spoil anycircumstance of another being, you are really spoiling your owncircumstance and you will have to face the very samecircumstance.Every circumstance is a ‘file’ and you have to deal withit with equanimity. For countless past lives one has beencontemptuous towards circumstances he did not like, and that iswhy in this life he has to have to face circumstances that bringnothing but contempt from every direction. Circumstancesrepresent the account of parmanus that are brought forth byvyavasthit. People keep cursing and pushing away bittercircumstances. Circumstances say, “We have come becausevyavasthit has sent us. If you curse us, vyavasthit will make youpay.” And people welcome with open arms circumstances thatare pleasant. If you remain within the circumstances, circumstanceswill perish and so will you but if you remain as the Self, separatefrom circumstances, You will remain separate and eternal.Bitter circumstances will still come even if you reject andrepel them and pleasant circumstances will still go away even ifyou invite them. You have wasted away countless past livesdoing just this; you have done nothing but adverse meditation. Ifyou want liberation, then remain as the Self (shukla dhyan) andif you want the worldly life, then maintain an attitude of helpingothers and avoid negative meditation (artadhyan andraudradhyan). A person who has dharma dhyan maintains theawareness, ‘It is my own past life’s account that brings forth thisbitter circumstance,’ when someone hurts him.

With penance andAptavani-2289290Aptavani-2renunciation you will attain a life in the celestial world, but notliberation. Liberation only comes when you become sahaj(natural and spontaneous). The practice of rituals of renunciationand penance are really tantamount to cranking the ‘handle’ (youhave to make an effort).If someone is not eating and you ask him, “Are you notwell? Is that why you are not eating?” he may reply, “No. I amfasting. I am doing penance.” You ask him, “How many days areyou going to fast?” He replies, “Four days.” So, is penancesupposed to calm a person or irritate him? This man becomesso irritable that the moment his son says anything, he reacts withso much anger, that the son thinks it would be better if his fatherwere not around. The Lord has said that if a person suffers fromconstipation or an upset stomach, he should eat once a day.Eating too much is poisonous but not eating is poisonous too.That is why the Lord had said to do penance of eating less i.e.keep the stomach a little empty. For example, if you eat fourrotlis (chapattis) everyday, start with eating only three and eatonly half the amount of rice. You will not have to do anypenance of fasting if you do this. So, give the body enough foodto keep it alive. Eating too much causes intoxication. Intoxicationis a liability. In satsang they tell you to read certain chapters inthe book. You eat some rice pudding and then you read yourassignment in bed. Reading in bed makes you drowsy. Youshould never eat to the point that it makes you drowsy.Some people fast for days at a time. The Lord equatesthis to the forced muzzling of animals that cannot eat their food(dhor langhan) for days. Really this penance makes one sufferphysically. It will not go unrewarded. These people will attain abirth in the celestial world. Even pleasures you indulge in willhave consequences. The Lord has said for us to remain withinnormal limits. He has said for us to follow a natural path, butpeople have not understood what the Lord had said and theypractice penance with a misunderstanding.Only the penance that comes to you naturally isworth doingPenance you learn from others is worthless. Your mind issubject to so much agitation from morning till night. Realpenance is to suffer the agitation and restlessness of the mind,speech and body, with serenity. That is true penance! What isthe point of becoming engrossed with your mind, speech andbody in their distressed state and when everything is quiet andserene, you subject yourself to the ‘heat’ of penance? Of whatuse is that penance? When has the Lord said for us to dopenance? It is when everyone brings you poison (problems andhurt), and despite the ‘heat’ that arises within you, you sufferwith serenity. You suffer calmly even when you become ‘red-hot’ from within. The Lord has not asked you to invite penance.He has told you to gladly welcome and suffer the penance thatcomes to you naturally. But people push away such penance.They frown upon it and hence they push it away and by doingso they increase that penance many fold, and on the other hand,they go out looking for penance to suffer. And if they cannot findit, they learn by watching others doing penance. You fools! Ispenance a thing you learn from others? Your penance is differentfrom his penance. Everyone’s penance is different. Everyone’scauses are different. In the current era of this time cycle,penance will come to you naturally and uninvited.Lord Mahavir has said, “Be cautious in the Kaliyug.Suffer the penance that unfolds in front of you; do not createpenance that does not come to you naturally.” If someone getsinto an accident with you and you get hurt, suffer that penancepeacefully. Instead people get into a fight and then undergofasting. You foolish people! Why must you do this? If yourhealth is not good, then undergo a little fasting, skipping a mealor two. There is no problem in doing that because it is a naturalthing to do. That also happens in the animal kingdom, but youdon’t need to resort to other nuisances of looking for penance.Aptavani-2289290Aptavani-2renunciation you will attain a life in the celestial world, but notliberation.

But people push away such penance.They frown upon it and hence they push it away and by doingso they increase that penance many fold, and on the other hand,they go out looking for penance to suffer. And if they cannot findit, they learn by watching others doing penance. You fools! Ispenance a thing you learn from others? Your penance is differentfrom his penance. Everyone’s penance is different. Everyone’scauses are different. In the current era of this time cycle,penance will come to you naturally and uninvited.Lord Mahavir has said, “Be cautious in the Kaliyug.Suffer the penance that unfolds in front of you; do not createpenance that does not come to you naturally.” If someone getsinto an accident with you and you get hurt, suffer that penancepeacefully. Instead people get into a fight and then undergofasting. You foolish people! Why must you do this? If yourhealth is not good, then undergo a little fasting, skipping a mealor two. There is no problem in doing that because it is a naturalthing to do. That also happens in the animal kingdom, but youdon’t need to resort to other nuisances of looking for penance.Aptavani-2291292Aptavani-2The Lord has said, “Do renunciation and penance during thethree time cycles of Dwapar, Treta and Satyug. But in the fourthera of this time cycle-Kaliyug, there will be no need to seekpenance and neither will you have to ‘pay’ for penance (go lookfor it).” During the time cycle where people had to look forpenance, it was the right thing to do because in those days evenif one looked for it all day long, he would not find it. Those timecycles are gone. Today opportunities for penance are plentiful.Even Lord Mahavir had to go looking for penance duringthose days! People did have penance, but not the Lord. Nopenance would come to the Lord, so He thought, “All thesepeople take so much care to have the opportunity to feed me,then they cook for me with so much care. That is why no oneinsults me; no one does anything to me and yet I have so manykarmas left.” The Lord could instinctively understand all this.Just as a person can tell he is going to vomit before he actuallydoes, in the same manner Gnanis can tell way in advance whena ‘vomit of karma’ is due to occur. A Gnani is able to incitedischarge of pending karmas prematurely (udirana). Humansdo have this ability. So Lord Mahavir thought, “I should moveaway from this nice area and go where there are primitivepeople whereby my karmas can come to an end. I still havepending karmas.” People around the Lord addressed Him witha lot of love and respect. They garlanded him with flowerswherever he went and that is why He decided to go to strangeand dangerous territories. The dangerous primitive area wasabout sixty miles away and was inaccessible by way of the mainroad. People came to bid the Lord farewell, but they beseechedHim, “Lord please do not to use this narrow path through thejungle. The serpent Chandkoshiya lives on this path. He doesnot let anyone use this path and anyone that does, he kills him.Lord, he will torment you.”But the Lord said, “You are telling me not to go, but it isnecessary for me to use only this path. This is what I see in myGnan. I do not insist, but this is what I see in my Gnan so pleaseremain calm and let me proceed.” So everyone in the townremained standing there only, no one entered the jungle. Whowould, having heard of the serpent Chandkoshiya? The Lordcan go if he wants. When it came to the foul-temperedChandkoshiya, they were ready to leave even the Lord. Wouldpeople not abandon the Lord?The Lord took the path through the jungle. SinceChandkoshiya serpent could smell the Lord, would he not goberserk? He would not let even wild animals come through, sohe came to the Lord very angry and bit him on his leg. As hebit the Lord, a little of the Lord’s blood went in his mouth andthe moment he tasted the Lord’s blood he came to rememberhis past life. The Lord gave Chandkoshiya a sermon: ‘ListenChandkoshiya! Calm down, calm down. Quieten your anger!’In his previous life, Chandkoshiya was an ascetic who used toget angry with his disciples and hence his current predicament.‘So be at peace now. According to the knowledge you have justattained, you are a pure Soul.’ As he gained knowledge,Chandkoshiya came to a realization that in his past life he wasan ascetic and that he used to get very angry with his disciples.His anger was no ordinary anger. It was not the kind a husbandhas for his wife now and then. Disciples are trapped and stuckwith their Guru and the Guru keeps abusing the helplessdisciples. Upon hearing these words of the Lord, Chandkoshiyafell. As he lay bleeding, his blood attracted many ants, whichtook no time in devouring his body. The ants kept pulling andtugging on his body and Chandkoshiya had to suffer a lot ofpain. But he suffered the penance quietly and took birth in ahigher life form.From here the Lord moved into the land of the primitivepeople. When these people saw him they started saying to eachother, “Just look at this mendicant. Where did he come from?Let’s throw stones at him. He is not even wearing clothes.

Let’sAptavani-2293294Aptavani-2beat him.” The Lord started to get a beating even before heentered their area, but He knew and had the awareness of, ‘Iam not taking the beating.” He had to suffer many insults andbeatings. Sometimes if he came across a kind person, he wouldget half a rotlo (unleavened bread made of millet flour). In thecivilized land he left behind, he could eat wonderful sweets anddesserts, but there were no such things to be found here! TheLord spent some time in the primitive area, destroyed hiskarmas and returned. Today, in the current era of this time cycle,people do not have to go looking for penance like the Lord did;penance will present itself to them in their own homes and yetpeople go looking for it. You foolish people! Lord Mahavir hadto walk sixty miles in search of penance!Today you are so fortunate that penance is to be found inyour own home, the minute you walk into your home, it is there;as you eat, it is there. This is where you have to suffer penance.The Lord had to go in search for penance; he had to walk sixtymiles to uncivilized areas. But don’t you find ‘primitiveness’nowadays just sitting at home? You are getting the penance freeof charge so why don’t you suffer it quietly. How fortunate arepeople of this day and age! This is what we call natural penance(prapta tapa). Your neighbors, your business partners, yourbrother, your wife, your children, etc., everyone will bring on thepenance. In the past time cycle, everything was very agreeableand people did not have any suffering. Life at home was verycomfortable and no body had to go outside looking forcomforts. This current era of Kaliyug is such that people don’tadjust anywhere. They do not adjust to situations. A personfinds family members who do not adjust, neighbors who do notadjust etc., so you must learn to suffer all that and adjustyourself.Prapta tapa is penance that comes on its own. You haveto accept and suffer it without hurting the other person, the nimit.Not only should you not hurt the other person, but also yourmind must not spoil towards that person; that is prapta tapa. TheLord has forbidden all other penance, but even then just look atall the different kinds of penance people are putting themselvesthrough. You foolish people! At least try to understand this!What is the point when a guru gets angry with his disciplesthroughout the day but fasts the next day for the anger? He willsay I want to fast two days. The reality nowadays is, if someday the disciples are not able to get food and cook for the guru,the guru should make do with whatever food there is. Why notmake do with just rice that day? Make adjustments here andthere as the situation calls for. Instead of completely abstainingfrom food for one day, why not adjust to whatever there is ona day-to-day basis? If some day the food is not ready on timeor when there is nothing to eat, adjust to the situation and sufferit quietly. The stomach is such that it will stop complaining if youput a little something in it. Even when you eat a little khichadeeand vegetables at night, does it complain? No it does not. Andyou are able to meditate if you want you. The stomach is not theproblem and neither is the mind, it is he, the one with the passion(kashaya) who is at fault. He is the culprit, the uncivilized one!He is the obstinate and misadjusting one. He suffers and spreadsthe suffering. What stupidity!People call each other anadi (primitive). It is impossibleto find a person who is not anadi in the entire city of Bombay,which is why they call each other anadi. You cannot speak thisway because the kind of anadi people the Lord was looking forare to be found in your very homes! That is why ‘Dada’ says,eat, have fun and when penance presents to you, suffer it calmly.There is no need to go seeking for penance; people areconstantly dishing it out to others. Those who seek penance donot suffer the penance that comes to them, but they go seekingfor penance that does not come, they create it and then sufferit. They undergo so much penance, that if someone were to sayeven the slightest thing to him or her, they explode!

PeopleAptavani-2295296Aptavani-2inclined towards penance are people who are ‘heated’; they arelike burning coals that are so hot that the moment you touchyour cigarette to it, it will catch fire. So you have to be verycautious when you interact with such people – there is no roomfor any mistakes there! The Lord was not like that. He wassupremely wise.Where is the shortage of prapta tapa nowadays? Ultimatelythe tooth will start to hurt and it hurts so bad that it takes yourbreath away. The stomach will hurt, the head will hurt, this willhurt, and that will hurt. If someone clashes with you, that isprapta tapa also. And sometimes when the husband is lategetting home from satsang, the wife will say, “You are sounreliable. Is this the time to be roaming around outside? Wherewere you wandering?” Now how does the wife know whetherhe was wandering or sitting in satsang? If the wife speaks thisway and he does not remain calm, is that not being foolish? Hejust has to realize that penance has come calling so he’d bettersuffer it. If he doesn’t do this and instead retaliates by saying,“You just keep quiet! I don’t want a word out of you!” then shewill be loading ‘bullets’ in her gun. If you ask her, what she isdoing she will reply, “Let him finish his meal, I will take care ofhim at bed time.” But in the end they still have to sleep in thesame room. If there was another room, one can say the heckwith it, “I don’t have to deal with this problem”, but alas, thereis only one room and they are both stuck with each other. Youfoolish man! You cannot have fireworks where you sleep and ifsome do happen to take place, douse them out. You can doanything outside but don’t do this at home where you have tolive day and night. Gnanis are very wise; they understandinstantly what is beneficial to the Self when someone throwsfireworks. The husband should understand and have insight thatthe wife threw the ‘firecracker’ at his leg because she wasangry, but if he were to do the same, she will aim for his headthe next time. So let go of your nonsense. Just deal with thesituation once and for all.True penance is one that you suffer and yet not let anyonearound you know of it. When you tell someone of your penance,they will listen to you and sympathize with you. And by doingso they take a cut in the ‘commission’ you gain from yourpenance and they may even put you on the wrong path. So howcan you tell anyone of your penance? Who would give away acommission to others without cause? The more sympathy youget from others for your penance, the more penance you willhave to suffer. ‘We’ have not taken any sympathy from anyone.If you take sympathy, you have to suffer more penance,otherwise keep quiet and keep accumulating the penance within.The heat of the penance is such that it will overflow, but then itwill simmer down. When the time comes, it will overflow forsure. It is said that we need all four: Gnan, darshan, charitra andtapa i.e. right knowledge, right vision, right conduct and penancefor moksha.

If you plant a neem seed, you will get bitter fruitsand if you plant a mango stone, you will get sweet fruits.Whatever fruit you want, plant accordingly. The penance forliberation is different altogether; it is antartapa (internal penance).Liberation has four pillars: knowledge, vision, conduct andpenance. Penance is one of the four pillars of liberation, butpeople have become fixed on doing just penance withoutunderstanding this. It’s like clinging on to just one leg of this bed.The body is not meant to be subjected to penance, the mind is,and that too without anyone’s knowledge. But today people justtake on external penance i.e. visible penance; they grab on towhatever comes along. What benefits will an ascetic attain if hedoes external penance? His body will grow stronger; thepenance his body is subjected to will fortify it. But is the bodygoing to come with him to his next life? It is going to becremated. As long as this body exists, you have to accomplishonly the work for liberation. Tyagis i.e. those who renounce aremerely exercising with penance. These are nothing but exercisecenters; they do nothing for the Soul. Men exercise in trying tolive without their wives and so they leave their wives andrunaway. The wife sometimes goes to live with her parents fora long time, does she not? So they can live at home also, whyshould men runaway from home? When a husband and wifequarrel everyday, their son makes a mental note, “I am not goingto have a wife.” He ties such a strong inner karmic knot of notwanting a wife, that when the karma unfolds to give effect, heruns away from his wife. Instead he should suffer his prapta tapa(the penance that has presented itself) and some day he willattain liberation if he continues to suffer the penance. Sufferingthat comes to you naturally is really a boon, and so what if itneeds to be suffered, at least you have not lost anything. And thefact that you attain something in return, if that is not a boon thenwhat else?To undergo penance and renunciation is really an exercisein a subject matter (vishay); it merely gives you encouragement.It is understandable that penance makes the body stronger butrenunciation is a different matter. ‘Tyage oosko aage’ - thatwhich one renounces, will have to be faced again, and it will bemultiplied many times.

WhoAptavani-2299300Aptavani-2needs reprimanding? It is those who have abandoned their wivesand children without understanding anything and have becomeegotistical about their penance and renunciation. They leavebehind three people at home and collect a hundred and eighthere; this is why ‘we’ have to speak so sternly.The Lord has said renunciation is to live in a palace andyet have no infatuation or attraction for that palace. If a person’spocket is picked and he does not even remember the loss, thenhe is free from it and hence has renounced it. If renunciationwere not defined as ‘renunciation of infatuation or obsession foranything’, then no one living the worldly life would attainabsolute liberation. The Lord has said that it is not possible torenounce things because there are infinite things in the world, sohow can anyone succeed at renouncing things? And besides isanything likely to go away simply through rejection? No it willnot. But by merely renouncing your infatuation and innerattraction for infinite things that exist, it is the same as renouncingthem.When a person practices renunciation, he does it onlythrough his ego. Absence of inner attraction for renunciation(tyaga) or acquisition (grahan) is true renunciation according tothe Lord. Renunciation that occurs naturally is true renunciation.Agitation in renunciationNo matter what the extent of external renunciation oneundergoes, if there is any trace of agitation (vishamta) in thatrenunciation, then one cannot see his own mistakes, but he willbe able to see the mistakes where there is equanimity (samata).An ascetic goes asking for food and if he happens to see a smallpiece of a potato in his bowl, he would become very upset.Then how can he see his mistake? There must be equanimity inrenunciation.Questioner : What is meant by agitation in renunciation?Dadashri : If a person renounces eating garlic and onion,but finds a piece of onion on his plate, he will go berserk andstart yelling. Some even feel repulsed merely at the sight of anonion, so what is their status? Do you call that equanimity?Questioner : No, that is agitation.Dadashri : Agitation is the result of such renunciation.Instead it would have been better not to renounce anything at all.The Lord says if a piece of potato ends up in a renunciant’splate by mistake, does it cause him any harm? Besides,everything that gets consumed is a ‘potato’! Lack of awarenessis the reason why such divisions have been made by the intellect.If a piece of a potato or an onion falls in the plate by mistake,that situation has to be simply resolved; should one not becapable of doing at least this much? Equanimity should never bedeparted from. If equanimity is maintained in renunciation, it cantake one to moksha. Is renunciation done for the purpose ofincreasing equanimity or increasing agitation? Renunciation is toincrease equanimity and if one is not able to maintain equanimityin renunciation, then that renunciation is useless. So first attainthe correct understanding from the Gnani and then renounce, butnot otherwise. This is a very large ‘hospital’; if you want toremain in the worldly life, you are free to do whatever you wantto but if you want liberation, you will have to consult the Gnani.Even the vitarag Lords have never scolded anyone. They wereso supremely wise; they were never contrary. Their disciplesmay deceive them, but they would never reprimand thedisciples. That is our goal too, is it not? This has fallen upon ‘us’as ‘our’ lot; the twenty-four Tirthankaras have left their‘goods’ and have said, ‘Dada’ is going to manifest, go to‘Dada’, and hence this has become ‘our’ task. ‘Our’ scoldingis purely out of compassion, ‘Our’ nature is vitarag. But theremedy has to fit the disease; as is the disease so has to be theremedy.

Onewill have peace if he maintains this much dharma (relativereligion).This world is at your disposal for enjoyment, but do nothurt anyone in the process. The one who wants to renounceshould do so without hurting anyone. If a person wants torenounce his family, he must ensure that first he has the blessingsfrom his wife. But instead men coerce their wives into givingthem the permission. A person can only renounce if everyonearound him is happy with his decision to do so.The Lord has said that a true renunciant is he whose meresight pleases others; he who evokes feelings of praise in thosewho look upon him; he who incites people to prostrate beforehim. He who makes people’s worries disappears and calms theirhearts.The Self has never, even for a moment becomes the non-self and neither has it desired any thing of the non-self. The Selfhas nothing to renounce, no chants to sing or no penance tosuffer. The renunciant has an illusion about renouncing for the Souland the family man has an illusion about the soul’s worldly life.Gnani’s Agnas verily are penance and religionThere is no need to expend anything on the path ofliberation; no need to renounce anything, no penance toperform, nothing needs to be done. You simply need to meet aGnani Purush and His agnas then become your penance andyour religion. After meeting the Gnani Purush, you will encountera new kind of penance; internal penance. Internal penance willlead to moksha and external penance will beget the worldly life.If someone insults you, you should perform internal pratikramaninstantly; that is internal penance.One has brought along with him this mind, speech andbody from birth. These are the main illusionary attachments(moha) and the main acquisitions (parigraha). All other infiniteforms of attachments and acquisitiveness (moha and parigraha)arise because of these three; which is why one cannot renounceeverything. The worldly life is very orderly and precise and thisorder is never broken. If it is in a person’s order (kram) torenounce, then he will but in return he will receive only theworldly life. There are infinite acquisitions (parigraha). Even ifyou have brought millions of parigraha, ‘we’ would still blessyou by placing ‘our’ hand on your head and make youaparigrahi (without any possessions). This non-acquisitivenesscomes only through an inner distinction in your understanding.This is the Akram path and the other is the Kramic path. In theKramic path a person will renounce everything and then goaway into the forest; however his mind, speech and body willstill be with him. His parigraha of mind, speech and body willalways be with him and they will give rise to a new worldly life,wherever he goes. In the path of Akram Vignan (step-lessscience towards Self-realization) however, there is liberation forone as he becomes non-acquisitive living amidst all there is toacquire. What was it like for Emperor Bharat? As an Emperor,he had all the pomp and luxuries of an empire, thirteen hundredwives, palaces etc. But despite all the material wealth, LordRushabhdev gave him the knowledge of Akram Vignan andbecause of that he was able to attain liberation despite livingamidst all luxuries.Many consider clothes as a parigraha and yet they willhave one hundred and eight disciples!

EvenAptavani-2305306Aptavani-2if this home were to burn down, ‘we’ would not be affected.Everything is natural. If someone were to take away ‘our’ dinnerplate, ‘we’ would tell him that ‘we’ have not eaten anythingsince the morning and would request him to leave the platealone, but if despite this he does not listen, ‘we’ would notobject. It is not parigraha to ask for something. ‘We’ may be aGnani but ‘we’ still have to ask for things. Gnani does not haveany attraction for a plate of food. The end can only be in sightif one becomes aparigrahi amidst all these parigraha; only thenwill he attain the bliss of the Self. But today people haveventured on the wrong path and yet they are not at fault;everything is dependant upon the effect of the current time cycle.‘We’ do not see anyone as being at fault.

The knowledge of Akram Vignan has manifested withinand it is an unprecedented victory.After attaining this Gnan, if someone were to give you a‘bitter medicine’ (insult you), it hurts your feelings. However, ifduring that time if you became still in the awareness of Gnan andobserve the inner turmoil, that is what the Lord has calledpenance of Gnan. The different phases of the worldly life arenatural occurrences, what is there to become agitated in that?The Lord has said that even if a person does not haveGnan, but has awareness, it too would suffice. However, He hasnot said that it is acceptable for one not to have awareness. Thepenance with Gnan only occurs after one attains the awarenessof the Self. The Lord has forbidden us to become ‘abnormal’ inmaking an effort, but he has also forbidden the abnormality ofnot making the effort! He has said for us to come into normalityin all different aspects. Anything done in abnormality, the Lordhas called it Vishay; worldly obsession.Nature i.e. prakruti makes you do penance and renunciationbut you believe, ‘I am doing penance.’ All these penance andrenunciation are relative; they are worldly or temporary efforts,and in the relative world, no one has the power to do anything.‘We’ are disclosing to you the ultimate and the final reality andthat is: ‘Whether you do chanting or penance, whether yourenounce or become an ascetic, whatever you do, you aremerely a top i.e. spinning toy.

Renunciationthrough vitaragata is an internal renunciation; in this one will nothave the intoxication (keyf) of ‘I did it’. Whereas in renunciation,due to unfolding of one’s karmas, he claims ‘I renounced’.There is nothing but ego in such renunciation and it causestremendous intoxication. The intoxication of renunciation is verysubtle and one which a person cannot get rid of, even throughintense suffering. So then how can he attain moksha with suchintoxication of ego? Moksha will be attained by those who arenot intoxicated and definitely not by those who are. Theintoxication of an alcoholic is better than this intoxication,because in the former, it will come down when you pour waterover his head. People are hopelessly caught up in tyaga-vairagya (renunciation and dispassion towards worldly life), butmoksha is not that easy to attain.Renunciation is that which does not give rise to attachment(moha). The renunciants are merely caught up in their innerattraction (murchha, moha) for renunciation. How can you callthat renunciation? Renunciation is for the one who has greatcourage. It is something that comes from within, it should benatural and spontaneous; it cannot be contrived. True renunciationis when there is no inner tendency to renounce or acquire. Truerenunciation is that in which the renunciant is not absorbed in therenunciation or the acquisition (I am Chandulal and I am doingthe renouncing or acquiring). That which is commonly referredto as renunciation, is renunciation with the aim of internalrenunciation, nevertheless it is not true renunciation.An ascetic used to sing everyday, “Tyaga cannot lastwithout vairagya.” (i.e. renunciation cannot last without dispassion;vairagya) So ‘we’ asked him, “Maharaj, and what wouldvairagya not last without?” Maharaj said he did not know. ‘We’then told him, “Vairagya does not last without inquiry, criticalthinking.” This statement is applicable to the Kramic path. It isa very arduous path, in which one moves back and forthRenunciationThere are two kinds of renunciations (tyaga): Renunciationthrough the ego and natural and spontaneous renunciation;renunciation that is evident as natural conduct.In fact, the ego is inherent in the very word ‘tyaga’ i.e. torenounce. Renunciation cannot be achieved without the ego andthat is why one will always have the belief and awareness of ‘Irenounced’. This belief will always remain, whereas whenrenunciation is natural and spontaneous, such awareness doesnot remain. One has conquered renunciation when one does noteven think about things that need to be renounced. What is themeaning of natural and spontaneous renunciation? The truerenunciant is one who does not even think about renouncing. Itis when one is not reminded of his worldly possessions. Truenon-renunciation is when there is no trace of any acquisition(parigraha) in his mind. In the path of liberation, there are noconditions that one has to renounce (tyaga) or acquire (grahan).One only needs to renounce two things in this world: Theego (I am Chandulal) and mamata (this is mine). Nothing elseremains to be renounced when these two are renounced.The Lord has said that when a person renounces due tothe unfolding of his karma (udayakarma), it is not therenunciation of vitaragata (non attachment). It is the unfolding ofone’s karma that makes one fast, makes one do samayik etc.,but he claims, ‘I did it’. Everything that the prakruti (non-self)makes you do forcibly is dependent upon the unfolding of thekarma. When the prakruti makes you renounce, how does itbenefit your soul (how is going to help you in liberation)? ThatAptavani-2307308Aptavani-2is not called renunciation through vitaragata.

It isa very arduous path, in which one moves back and forthRenunciationThere are two kinds of renunciations (tyaga): Renunciationthrough the ego and natural and spontaneous renunciation;renunciation that is evident as natural conduct.In fact, the ego is inherent in the very word ‘tyaga’ i.e. torenounce. Renunciation cannot be achieved without the ego andthat is why one will always have the belief and awareness of ‘Irenounced’. This belief will always remain, whereas whenrenunciation is natural and spontaneous, such awareness doesnot remain. One has conquered renunciation when one does noteven think about things that need to be renounced. What is themeaning of natural and spontaneous renunciation? The truerenunciant is one who does not even think about renouncing. Itis when one is not reminded of his worldly possessions. Truenon-renunciation is when there is no trace of any acquisition(parigraha) in his mind. In the path of liberation, there are noconditions that one has to renounce (tyaga) or acquire (grahan).One only needs to renounce two things in this world: Theego (I am Chandulal) and mamata (this is mine). Nothing elseremains to be renounced when these two are renounced.The Lord has said that when a person renounces due tothe unfolding of his karma (udayakarma), it is not therenunciation of vitaragata (non attachment). It is the unfolding ofone’s karma that makes one fast, makes one do samayik etc.,but he claims, ‘I did it’. Everything that the prakruti (non-self)makes you do forcibly is dependent upon the unfolding of thekarma. When the prakruti makes you renounce, how does itbenefit your soul (how is going to help you in liberation)? ThatAptavani-2309310Aptavani-2between the fire and the frying pan. The Soul cannot be attainedonly through renunciation. Renunciation is a process that entailsgreat physical suffering. If liberation were to be attained throughrenunciation, then liberation would also entail suffering. The Lordhas said that liberation is a natural process and is easily attained.Even in the Kramic path, if you are going to renounce thendo so only if that renunciation results in elimination of anger,pride, deceit and greed. Renunciation that increases anger,pride, deceit and greed, is not renunciation.The Lord has said, “Remain in pure awareness (shuddhaupayog).” Nevertheless, if you still have greed for the worldlylife and want worldly happiness, then do not hurt anyone andmake others happy. Attain such qualities and renounce thosethat hurt others. But if you desire Moksha, then simply remainin the awareness of the Self.When you keep only that which is necessary, it isconsidered renunciation. It is renunciation when you do not keeptwelve shirts when you need only four. Renunciation is to makedo with what you have. Only the person who has the GnaniPurush to guide him is allowed to renounce, otherwise if anyonetries to renounce, he will inevitably come under the growinginfluence of intoxication of his renunciation.There are two categories of worldly people: those inclinedtowards renunciation of worldly life (tyagi) and the othersinclined towards worldly life (sansari). In the former whenintoxication of renunciation increases then the latter is illuminated.And when the intoxication increases in the movement towardsworldly life, illumination occurs in the movement of renunciation.Lord has said that one can become a vitarag from any state,from the state of a renunciant or from one living a family life. Awoman too can become a complete vitarag. The only requirementis that one has to be in a human form. Neither of the two hasa monopoly over illumination.There is no need to renounce anything for liberation.Renunciation should be natural and spontaneous. There is noneed for any other type of renunciation. All other renunciationsare from the perspective of illusion and ignorance. Lord’srenunciation is real renunciation. What is renunciation of theillusionary perspective like? When a smoker quits smoking, hethinks he has renounced smoking, and the one who made himquit thinks it was because of him that the other person quitsmoking. Even a small child would understand this illusionaryrenunciation of his uncle quitting smoking.What kind of renunciation is this ?A sheth once said to me, “When you are on your dailywalk, please come and visit me for an hour or so. We will spendsome time together.” He was a good man; ‘we’ used to sit withhim for half an hour or so. Usually his bidis (hand-rolledcigarettes) were short but one day he rolled a twelve-inch longbidi and began to smoke. So ‘we’ asked him, “Why are yousmoking such a long bidi?” The Sheth told me, “The Maharaj(his guru) has told me to smoke only four bidis a day. I told himthat I would not be able to do so but he insisted that I abide byhis instructions.”“Hmmm…is that how you are carrying out his instruction?”Seeing this ‘we’ saluted this era! Later, after smoking half thebidi, he took two more leaves and began to roll them at thebottom of the bidi. So ‘we’ asked him, “Sheth, what are youdoing?” He told me, “Because I am not satisfied with smokingonly four long ones!”‘We’ salute your fortune! Even Lord Mahavir did notknow such things. You have knowledge of what even LordMahavir could not see in his fully enlightened state of omniscience(keval Gnan)!! ‘We’ applaud you! Today ‘we’ discovered thatsuch minds exist.

Pure renunciation is whenone does not become one (tanmayakar) with thoughts thatarise within the mind or with any subatomic particles (parmanus)of speech that arises. No matter how good or bad the thoughtsthat arise in the mind are, the Lord considers it renunciation ifone remains separate from them, and does not becomeengrossed in them. The Lord calls it absolute renunciation whenone does not become one with any parmanu of speech thatarises within or expresses externally. This verily is what leads tomoksha. From the worldly perspective, the meaning ofrenunciation is different altogether. However, it is not consideredrenunciation from the real perspective. Not even a penny’sworth of the relative perspective of renunciation will be of usewith reference to moksha. When can one not become one(tanmayakar) with his circumstance? It is when he becomes theSelf. The one who was impure becomes pure when the GnaniPurush bestows upon him the state of the pure Self and onlythen does the Lord’s renunciation become a reality within. Howsimple and straightforward is this! Otherwise, it is not possibleto attain such a state in countless lifetimes.Even if one were to understand the real meaning ofexternal renunciation, one could accomplish a lot.

You cannot shunanyone and then claim that it was your unfolding karma. Trueunfolding of karma is when you can leave home with theblessings of your wife, children, parents, your neighbors etc.;where everyone is pleased with your decision. The othersituation is also the unfolding of karma, but it is not with theconsent of your loved ones and therefore it is not consideredtrue unfolding of karma.

Many say God is up there, but that is not so.People’s understanding is incorrect which is precisely why ‘we’have to say it candidly that there is not a parmanu in this worldthrough which ‘we’ have not traversed. Living within as well asoutside this universe, ‘we’ are saying things exactly as ‘we’ seethem and exactly as they are. Furthermore, ‘we’ assure you thatthere is no God up there. People have needlessly created a messby saying ‘the one up there…the one up there.’ Everything youdo with the belief that God is up there, will be in vain. All yourprayers, good intentions and time will be wasted. There is noone up there to listen to your message; your message reaches noone. If you talk to Him where he truly is; which is within you,then one day your request will reach Him. Otherwise, you canalso worship Him in an idol, because you can see the idoldirectly in front of you. It does not matter if it is made of stonebut people accept it. You may not believe in it, but people haveaccepted it; they have instilled their living bhaav (chaitanyabhaav, pratishtha) in that idol. The belief that God is up thereis a wrong belief; it is a wrong address. If you mail a letterwithout addressing it correctly, whom will it reach? Look at theone within. God is within you and nowhere else. Let me give youthe correct address of God: ‘God is in every creature, whethervisible or invisible.’If you see God in every creature, then you will not havean inner intent of hurting any living being and so you will besaved from bhaav himsa (intent of violence; inner intent thatbinds karma of violence). People are constantly doing bhaavhimsa. What are anger, pride, deceit and greed? They are allbhaav himsa and this is precisely where the Lord has said for usto become ahimsak (non-violent). However, people set out toprotect cows and elephants from violence. Who are you to savethe elephants? And who really gives these animals life?

The bugs willdie when it is time for them to. Who has the right to kill them?Only the one who can create them! The Lord says, “Whateveryou can create, you may destroy. I do not interfere when youare destroying what you have created. Therefore do not killanything.” It is so easy to understand such simple language, is itnot? It is not possible to create a single bed bug, even if youwant to. And yet, these fools do whatever they please; they killso many bugs! They take so many lives.Power of intentExcept for intentions (bhaav), nothing new happens in thislife. Having created the intent to hurt or kill in countless pastlives, whatever bugs that are meant to die, will die at the handsof the one who has made such intent. Nothing else happens.When it is time for the bugs to die, who gets to kill them? It ishe who had made the intent to kill. No one has a right to kill,but is there not a time for every bug to die?

It isonly the coming together of circumstances, such as one’s intent(bhaav) of wanting to kill and the timing for the bugs to die.Every creature has its own time to die; no living being can diebefore its time. If a person or any living being could kill anotherbefore its due time, then it can be said that they are killing. Butno, that is not the case because no one can kill before the duetime of death. Furthermore, only when it is time for a living beingto die, will he encounter his ‘killer’ (nimit). Only when it is timefor the bugs to die, will they encounter ‘Chandulal’.

In his past life he had made the intent to kill and hence hebecomes instrumental in the process. Insects have a pre-determined karmic account as to when they will die even beforethey are born. This is the case with every living being. It ismerely the ego which makes one say, “I killed, I saved.”The Lord says, “No living being can kill another livingbeing. All one does is killing of one’s own soul (bhaav maran).”To say, “I want to kill whatever bugs there are”, is bhaav maran.Say there are four snakes in your farm and you want to killthem. You may or may not have the opportunity of killing them;there is no way of telling.

So all you have to do is shout out loud, “There is a snakein my house”, and those people will automatically come runningbecause they have made it their business!An arrow fired by one who has non-violent intent(ahimsak bhaav), will not cause any bleeding but a flowerthrown by one with intent to hurt (himsak bhaav), will. Thearrow and the flower are not as effective as the intent behindthem. Therefore, behind every word of ‘ours’, there is aconstant bhaav of, ‘Let no one be hurt; not a single living beingbe hurt through the speech.’ This speech comes out constantlywith the inner intent of not hurting any living being in the slightestthrough the mind, body and speech. Objects or things donothing; the arrow or the flower does not make the impact, butthe intent behind them, does. Therefore, every one of you shouldhave such intent. Every morning you should make a firm decisionand say five times, “Let not any living being be hurt through mymind, body and speech.” If you do this much with a true innerintent, then the Lord says that even if you do happen to hurtsomeone, you are not responsible.

The Lord says, “It takes somany causes to come together for you to be able to kill even asingle bug.” The killer merely does the bhaav, ‘I want to kill’, butso many other circumstances have to come together too besidesthis intent created by the killer. Do you think your father ownsthis world? If he did, don’t you think he would have thrown youout a long time ago? But really there is no telling when one isgoing to drop dead. It is merely the ego that gets hurt; the egobecomes exposed in all this; that is all. The Lord has said, “Youhave to have inner intent of compassion (bhaav-daya).” Bhaav-daya does not mean to save the bugs from being killed, but thebhaav one gets to kill the insects, causes destruction of yourSelf. And because it kills your self, you should have compassiontowards your Self (bhaav- daya). That is bhaav-daya, to havecompassion for your precious Self. You should be primarilyconcerned with compassion for your own Self; insects andpeople have brought their own karmic accounts with them.Every living being brings his own karmas with him; they are allindependent.

They are claiming that they can wipeoff Russia within an hour!Protect and preserve your intent onlyNo one has the independent control over anything;therefore you simply need to be careful that you do not becomeinstrumental in the killing of your own self. When you have intentto kill any living being, you are actually killing your atmabhaav,your Self. That is why you should maintain kindness towardsyour own Self (bhaav-daya). The Lord did not tell us to havekindness towards others and yet people are preoccupied withdoing just that. Let go of this madness! How can you feel sorryfor others when there is no telling what is going to happen toyou? And then one becomes heavily laden with the ego in doingso, “I feel terribly sorry for them…I feel very sad for them…”you foolish people, why don’t you worry about yourself first?What kind of a creature are you?A butcher and a sanghpati (administrative head of areligious organization) approached the Lord. The sanghpati toldthe Lord, “I rescued ten cows from being slaughtered by thebutcher.” The Lord said, “You are right, you saved ten cows.”The butcher says, “Sir, I killed ten cows. Now which one of uswill achieve liberation first?” The Lord replied, “Neither of youshould talk about liberation. You are both egotistic and not fit forliberation. You have an ego of killing cows and he has the egoof saving them. Why don’t you save your aging father? Why areyou saving the cows? You are letting your eighty-year-old fatherdie; why are you letting him die? If you are the savior, if you cansave lives forever, then why don’t you save your own father?”This is nothing but over wise-ness. This is over-wise madness.Do not interfere with worldly entanglements; remain withinboundaries. These are all over wise people looking for fame.What are they looking for? They want fame and in due time theymay get it here in the worldly life but over there (in the laws ofkarma); they will make minced meat out of them! There isnothing but pure justice in nature’s hand and absolutely no onehas any influence over that. The Lord has said, “You have theego of saving ten cows and you have the ego of killing ten cows.Neither of you should come here to listen to talks of liberation,because you will get the fruit of saving ten cows and you will getthe fruit of killing ten cows. The lives you have saved will returnthe favor through benevolence towards you and those you havekilled will verily be the ones who will torment you. This is theonly account there is. I do not interfere in that and it has nothingto do with liberation.”If you pass a few college students in their exams, whenthey grow up, they will say, “He is the professor, who passedus,” and they will appreciate you that way. Naturally, it is thesame for all living beings you save. The Lord has not said thatin order to attain liberation it is necessary to save lives. PeopleAptavani-2317318Aptavani-2know what is under your control. The Lord says, “It takes somany causes to come together for you to be able to kill even asingle bug.” The killer merely does the bhaav, ‘I want to kill’, butso many other circumstances have to come together too besidesthis intent created by the killer. Do you think your father ownsthis world? If he did, don’t you think he would have thrown youout a long time ago? But really there is no telling when one isgoing to drop dead. It is merely the ego that gets hurt; the egobecomes exposed in all this; that is all. The Lord has said, “Youhave to have inner intent of compassion (bhaav-daya).” Bhaav-daya does not mean to save the bugs from being killed, but thebhaav one gets to kill the insects, causes destruction of yourSelf. And because it kills your self, you should have compassiontowards your Self (bhaav- daya). That is bhaav-daya, to havecompassion for your precious Self. You should be primarilyconcerned with compassion for your own Self; insects andpeople have brought their own karmic accounts with them.Every living being brings his own karmas with him; they are allindependent.

They will take them to a Brahmin and give him thecows for free and say, “Sir, you take them.” The butcher keepsa close watch on where the cows are tied and so he goes to theBrahmin’s home and asks, “Are you in debt?” the Brahmin says,“Yes, I have a debt of one hundred and fifty rupees.” So theButcher would offer him fifty rupees and the Brahmin willcounter offer, “Give me one hundred and fifty rupees and all thecows are yours.” So the butcher pays him one hundred and fiftyrupees and brings the cows back! Therefore he sold the cowsfor four hundred rupees and bought them back for one hundredand fifty. This is how he fools people.

What is this yoga? Actually, thesoul is spread throughout the whole body, but through this yoga,it is pulled upwards towards the crown of the head(brahmarandhra). The heart and the pulse will stop when thesoul is pulled all the way into the brahmarandhra.

If a person performs such yoga at the age of 15 years,three months, three days, three hours and three minutes, and ifthat yoga lasts for one thousand years, then at the end of thethousand years, his life span will begin again at the age of 15years, three months, three days, three hours and three minutes.His life span is proportionately used up in accordance with thenumber of heartbeats that were expended up to that point intime. A person’s duration of life is dependant upon the numberof his or her heartbeats. In doing this yoga, for whateverduration of time the heart stops beating, his life span is sparedfor that duration of time. Ordinarily people cannot save it, onlythose who perform this kind of yoga can do so. The body willnot rot or shrivel and it will not smell. It will remain the same aslong as there is a presence of the soul in it. It does not mattereven if the body becomes like a stone because of this yoga.Questioner : What is the state of the soul during thistime?Dadashri : It is as if the soul is tied up in a sack.

But is that likelyjust because they believe so? It is only when the soul leavesnaturally through the crown. Just because someone says mokshais attained if life departs through the eyes, does that mean youhave to remove it from the eyes by putting chili pepper in theeyes? No, things should happen naturally.Questioner : Does the soul depart through the openingsin our body, like the eyes or the nose?Dadashri : Yes, that is the sign. The sense openings arefive but the places one can go to are innumerable, so how canwe know? If the ‘jiva’ (soul laden with karma) departs from themouth, it can go to countless places. These are all uncertaintalks. One can never find a solution there.What is Kundalini ?Questioner : What do they mean when they say that onecan see a light (prakash) when the kundalini (the energy thatexists within yoga chakras) is awakened?Dadashri : The observer of that light is the pure Soul andone that becomes engrossed in this vision is the pratishthit atmaor the relative self. A person will experience happiness for theduration he remains engrossed in this and when it passes, he isback to where he started. What kind of colors do you see?Questioner : A white light, which I have never seenbefore.Dadashri : One gets happiness from whatever hebecomes engrossed in. You even get pleasure from readingfiction novels but you bind unnecessary karmas with it. Insteadof awakening the kundalini, why not awaken your atma (soul)?People are stuck at the ‘station’ of kundalini. This is same asgetting down at a station with black sticky soil per Guru’sinstructions; when the rain falls it will produce black sticky soil.What good is that? ‘We’ have found the ultimate station here.There are countless stations where gurus can get you lost. Youwill find stability and comfort there but of what use is stabilityand comfort for liberation?By awakening the kundalini, one can see things, but theywere already there to begin with. Nirvikalp samadhi means thestate of absolute unaffectedness amidst all stresses withinthoughts, speech and acts. This can only be attained when one’svision is turned towards the Self and when one’s knowledge isdirected towards the Self. This is attained only when onebecomes the Self.Questioner : Dada the light of kundalini arises within me.Dadashri : It is a tool for concentration (ekagrata) andthat is why that light arises and you experience happiness.People mistakenly believe that to be the soul, but that light is notthe soul. The one who ‘sees’ that light, is the Soul. The light isthe object (drashya) and the seer (drashta) is the Self. The Selfthat ‘we’ have given you is the observer of the light.Questioner : I see a light when I concentrate and thisincreases my happiness.Dadashri : That is relative happiness. Do you know whatit is like? It is like the happiness you experience after eatingsweets. Still, it is good. People need something to comfort themin the endless worldly suffering, do they not? It is fine as long asthey have not found the right path.Anahat naad – Soundless soundsQuestioner : What is anahat naad?Dadashri : It means to capture sound from any part ofthe body; it can be from the heart, the elbow, the wrists etc.Then they concentrate and focus their attention on that soundand progress from there on. It is difficult to understand the kindAptavani-2325326Aptavani-2moksha, which is why they practice this yoga. But is that likelyjust because they believe so?

The one who ‘sees’ that light, is the Soul. The light isthe object (drashya) and the seer (drashta) is the Self. The Selfthat ‘we’ have given you is the observer of the light.Questioner : I see a light when I concentrate and thisincreases my happiness.Dadashri : That is relative happiness. Do you know whatit is like? It is like the happiness you experience after eatingsweets. Still, it is good. People need something to comfort themin the endless worldly suffering, do they not? It is fine as long asthey have not found the right path.Anahat naad – Soundless soundsQuestioner : What is anahat naad?Dadashri : It means to capture sound from any part ofthe body; it can be from the heart, the elbow, the wrists etc.Then they concentrate and focus their attention on that soundand progress from there on. It is difficult to understand the kindAptavani-2327328Aptavani-2of ‘station’ this is. There are so many kinds of such ‘stations’ butyou will not find the Soul via these stations. Those are not pathsfor acquiring the Soul for liberation. These practices are not themain goal, but stations that come on the way to the main goal.They are canteens; stops along the way to the path of liberation!If you become the Soul (through Self-realization), then youbecome established in the Self (brahmanishtha), and then yourwork is completed. Otherwise the Maharaj (the guru) himselfdoes not dwell in the Self, he is attached to the world, so howis he going to be beneficial to you?Brahma (the Self), is in everyone for sure, but they are allattached to the world. Right now people have their attachment tothe world; they want to enjoy all the worldly pleasures. But theGnani Purush takes that attachment and places you in the Self,thus fracturing the attachment to the world. It is only after this thatyou arrive at the final destination and can walk around in bliss.You do not achieve anything by wasting your time at the middlestations. Not a single negative attribute of yours will go away.How can any negative attribute go away when you have thefeeling, ‘I am Chandulal and this is my station?’ Vedanta tooproclaims, ‘Nothing can be achieved without the knowledge ofthe Soul.’What does this anahat naad (the silent sound) suggest? Itis paudgalik; it is physical and of the non-Self. What does it dofor the Soul? Nothing. It cannot be the Soul. If it was truly thesound of the Soul, or even if it were related to the Soul(anushangik), then no one or nothing in this world will botheryou. But it will bother you if it is of the non-self. Therefore,should you not understand what this is all about?Still, ‘we’ will not interfere with those who like to plungeinto this. For them it is correct. They are fine where they are at.And they are fine in their beliefs until they attain the knowledgeof the Self.* * * * *Dhyan – MeditationYama, niyam, asana, pranayam, pratyahaar, dharna,dhyan and samadhi are eight parts of the Yoga. When youattain knowledge of the Self through Akram Vignan, you havealready surpassed all these eight stages. Beyond these eightsteps, you have even attained the awareness of the Soul (yourown Self). Here you have to keep both the body and the soulsahaj (natural and spontaneous). For you the experience(anubhav), the awareness (laksha) and the conviction (pratiti)of the Soul has already been established. Here in the AkramPath, you will never fall below this stage of conviction (pratiti).People sit to meditate, but do they have a goal in mind?They haven’t even visualized the goal, so what can they meditateon, a buffalo? To meditate without a goal is called updhyan.God has not instructed anyone to meditate on the Soul in theform of words. What is the definition of ultimate meditation?

All this cannot remain in your awareness at the sametime.

They tell you toAptavani-2329330Aptavani-2concentrate on the air that flows in and out of your nostrils.Breaths flow in and out, but what in the dickens are you goingto do with that focus? What in the dickens do your nostrils haveanything to do with it? Let go of this foolishness! Why don’t youdo this when you get an asthma attack? How can you? They saythat when the breath goes in, it makes the sound ‘so’ and uponexhalation it sounds like ‘hum’. From that you get ‘sohum’‘sohum’, ‘humso’, ‘humso’, and they tell you to meditate onthat. But the Soul is neither ‘sohum’ nor ‘humso’. The Soul isnot to be found in that word. Vitarag Lords have used the word‘Atma’ as a way for us to understand the Soul in a word form.However, the Soul is not to be found in books or in thescriptures, here only the word ‘Atma’ is to be found. The realor true Atma is to be found only with the Gnani. Do you thinkthat by observing your breaths in and out, you will remain insamadhi? No. What happens there? The mind gets destroyed.The mind is like a boat; it is necessary to cross the ocean of theworldly life and reach across to the other shore.Meditating as the Self is the true meditation.

Awareness of ‘I am pure Soul’ (laksha)can only be attained upon the union of the one who is seekingthe Self (dhyata), the goal (dhyeya, the Self) and the process(dhyan). Here in ‘our’ presence, there is no need for you toperform dhyan, as you have already attained the Self.

When you are inthe dhyan of the Self (Shuddhatma i.e. the pure Soul) and a ‘file’comes, settling it with equanimity is dharma dhyan. Of what useis the meditation (dhyan) on the object (dhyeya, Self) once it hasbeen attained, i.e. when the goal has been reached?

In the other paths thereis no dhyata (Real dhyata is one who has realized the Self;realized ‘who am I?’), and yet they seek it. In other words,without knowing the Self, they are reaching out towards it.People are trying to decide on their aim (dhyeya) without evenknowing the dhyata (their real identity, the target, the final goal,the Self). When does one become a dhyata? It happens whenthe world falls into oblivion. But instead when one is sitting inmeditation and someone asks him, ‘who are you?’, he will reply,‘I am a judge’. This means his meditation (dhyan) is in being ajudge, so how can the dhyata (the goal of being the Self) comein to decision?Nevertheless, until one meets a Gnani Purush and attainsthe awareness of the Self, there is a need for such instrumentsfor peace of mind. Even if one meditates on the photograph ofa guru who is not Self-realized but is relatively pure and freefrom worldly desires and passions; then one will attain peace ofmind. Even if that guru is laden with ego, meditating on hispicture will bring calmness to the mind. This is relative dhyan; itis temporary but helpful. The other is the real dhyan and it canonly be attained from the Gnani Purush; the real dhyan will giveyou permanent peace. The peace and happiness one attainsfrom relative dhyan will break the moment one’s mother-in-lawtells her, “You have no sense”, then all turmoil and agitation willstart. These relative meditations will not get your ‘work’ done;they will not give you eternal bliss. What does the Gnani Purushdo? He blesses you with Gnan which renders you unperturbedand untouched (nirleyp) and this knowledge is eternal bliss.What should one do when he meets a Gnani? He does not haveto perform any more worldly rituals; he simply has to abide byHis Agnas.

If samadhi can be achieved by pinching thenostrils, then even a small child should be able to achieve thesame by doing so. Try and pinch a small child’s nose and seewhat he does? He will instantly get upset and bite you! Thisproves that it causes suffering, so what good is such a Samadhiladen with physical suffering? Samadhi should be a natural andspontaneous state (sahaj).

Achieving samadhi by pinching the nostrils ishathayoga (practicing with ego). How can one have samadhithrough persistence of ego related action (hatha)? If someonewere to remove his guru’s picture, he would become veryrestless within. Samadhi should be constant and without anyunrest. That which does not change, that which does not leaveis samadhi. That which results in turmoil is called upadhi(external difficulty). It is like the discomfort one feels when hegoes out into the sun after sitting in a shade.

People look for solitudeto practice their samadhi. There is no solitude anywhere in thisworld, so where will you go? There is no end to crowds in thisworld. To find solitude in a crowd is Gnan. When you are in acrowded train, surrounded by crowds of people from all sides,the mind, the intellect, the chit and the ego will remain quiet andthen as much solitude as needed is available. Real solitude(opportunity to be the Self) is available only in heavy crowds(stresses from all aspects of the non-self). Solitude in a crowdis true solitude.The ascetics sit in samadhi; they renounce their worldlylife, they go to the Himalayas and then they meditate, ‘I am nota sadhu, I am not this. I am not that.’ In doing this theyexperience some happiness but their samadhi is not thenirvikalp samadhi (bliss of freedom from ego) that theyexperience because they have not entered within withunderstanding.Questioner : I know someone who attains samadhi evenwhile standing. He cannot hear us even if we shout.Dadashri : That is not called samadhi; that isunconsciousness. What is samadhi? Samadhi is a natural state.It is true samadhi where all the five senses are awake and alert;the person will have awareness when someone touches him. Youcannot call it samadhi where there is no awareness of the body.That kind of samadhi is the result of unduly subjecting the bodyto suffering (kasht samadhi). It can never be called samadhiwhere there is undue suffering of the body. The one who hastrue samadhi has complete awareness.Nirvikalp samadhiWhat have the worldly spiritual masters believed nirvikalpsamadhi to be? They believed them to be miracles of the chit(chit chamatkar). When they lose awareness of their physicalbody, they believe that all the information from the sense organs(indriya gnan) has come to an end. But the knowledge beyondthe senses (atiindriya gnan) has not arisen and therefore theyare wondering in the zone of play of the chit. They see all kindsof effects of the chit. In this, some see a white light but that isnot a true samadhi; it is nirindriya (without sensory input)samadhi. It is not samadhi if you lose awareness of the body. Onthe contrary, there is greater and acute awareness of the bodyin nirvikalp samadhi. How can one call it nirvikalp samadhi whenhe verily loses the awareness of the body?Questioner : What is a nirvikalp samadhi?Dadashri : ‘I am Chandulal’ is vikalp samadhi. Everythingthat one sees is also vikalp samadhi. When a child breakssomething precious, it breaks Chandulal’s peace.Questioner : What is the meaning of sankalp andvikalp?Dadashri : Vikalp means ‘I’ and sankalp means ‘my’.One (the self) becomes that which it imagines to be (kalptaru,kalpswarup). Whatever vikalp is made, one becomes that.When one says, “I am Chandulal,” he becomes that. When hesays, “I am unhappy,” he becomes that. This projection is thevikalp. So this goes under ‘I’ and ‘mine’. That vikalp can neverbe broken until he attains the knowledge of the Self, and hencehe can never become vikalp-less (nirvikalp). ‘I renounced this’,‘I read so many scriptures’, ‘I performed so many worships’etc., are all vikalps. These vikalps remain entrenched andAptavani-2335336Aptavani-2even performing your daily activities.

All these are merely words and everythingremains only as words. Only vitarag Lords and their followerswere in nirvikalp samadhi. They simply remained ‘knower’ of allthat unfolded whether right or wrong. They were ‘knower’ ofstones that were hurled at them as well as ‘knower’ of garlandsof flowers that were offered to them. How can you call themvitarags if they are not ‘knower’? But some assert, ‘We are innirvikalp samadhi,’ just because their awareness of the body isgone. Awareness of the body is absent even during sleep, sothat too can be called nirvikalp samadhi, right? Those who loseawareness of their body when they are awake and see lightwhen their chit is actively projecting are experiencing only that,nothing else. That is not the ultimate state. It is a grave mistaketo believe and affirm so. In nirvikalp samadhi there is completeawareness of the body, as well as the Self. Otherwise, vitaragLords would not be able to see anything in their keval Gnan.No one really understands nirvikalp samadhi; everyonehas different connotations of it in their own language (bhasha).People have also interpreted the Soul in their own language andyet they say, “I want to have knowledge of the Soul.”The impurity of the chit of the sant purush (a saint whois in the process of seeking liberation) or those who havereached similar spiritual level is significantly reduced. So theypunish their body whenever a desire for something worldlyarises within them, ‘Why do you have these desires?’ They evenput chili pepper in their eyes! Now what would foreigners sayabout such a gnan (knowledge)? They will say, “He must becrazy.” Muslims too would think they are crazy. But people here(Hindus) regard them as wise. They put chili pepper in their eyesbecause the eyes made a mistake in seeing ‘something wrong’.Here the fault lies with the one who sees.People in India are such that they will even put a lock ontheir mouth! These people believe that loss of bodily awarenessis nirvikalp samadhi. They believe they have entered thedimension beyond the senses (atiindriya state, nirvikalp state)because the information through the senses is not comingthrough (nirindriya state). They think that they have entered thenirvikalp state (atiindriya state). No! The atiindriya state is waybeyond that. They have discarded awareness of the senses; theyhave not yet attained the state of atiindriya state. So where arethey? They are in a nirindriya state; a state void of senses. Andin this nirindriya state, they keep saying, ‘Hum, hum (‘I amsomething, I am something’), and believe they are in the state ofa nirvikalp samadhi.Still, their intentions are good. Their intention behindputting chili powder in their eyes is good; therefore they willattain liberation some day.In the Kramic path, nirvikalp samadhi begins when one isvery near to attaining the final liberation, whereas here in theAkram path, you (addressing the mahatmas who have receivedGnan) have already attained the state of nirvikalp samadhi. Inthe Kramic path you have to suffer all necessary penance till thevery end. You have to suffer the penance of loach; hair pluckingritual, and other penances and rituals. In the Kramic path thedoer is a separate entity, karma is separate, the knower isseparate but at the same time one claims, “I have to do dhyan.”Hence there the ‘doer’ (the one meditating), the goal (dhyeya),and the process of meditation (dhyan), are all separate. But onlywhen these three unite as one, can there be a little experienceof the bliss of nirvikalp. But in the Kramic path, the sense ofdoer-ship remains till the end. That is why they say, “I am doingdhyan.”Dhyeya, which is the goal, is to be nirvikalpi and dhyata;338Aptavani-2Aptavani-2337therefore he cannot say, “I am the Soul.” As long as theawareness and the belief, ‘I am Chandulal’, ‘I am a priest’, ‘Iam an ascetic’ etc.,’ has not gone, how can he say, ‘I am a pureSoul?’ And until then how can he attain nirvikalp samadhi (blissof the egoless state)?

Still, the scriptures say because a vikalpi does dhyan ofthe nirvikalpi, he will one day become nirvikalpi. But it does notallow one to become nirvikalpi and one continues to say, “I haveto do this.

So they meditateon the nirvikalp state, in order to climb out of the hole of avikalpi state.‘We’ have not just given you a nirleyp Atma i.e. a Soulwhich remains absolutely free from all worldly entanglements,but ‘we’ have also given you nirvikalp samadhi.

Wherever onehas to undergo a process of renunciation or acquisition, therewill always be vikalp there, namely ‘I have to renounce’ or ‘Ihave to attain’. Vikalp is bound to occur whenever somethingsignificant has to be attained and trivial things have to berenounced. There is not just one vikalp but infinite vikalps. Tobe strict with disciples or to discipline them is also a vikalp.True darshan is one that brings samadhi by just looking atthe person.

It is a samadhi which will not go awayeven if you try to get rid of it! If you tell the samadhi to go, itwill not. Once the ego of doer-ship is gone, it can never comeback.

Thisstate of ‘silence’ cannot remain for more than forty-eightminutes, for anyone. Samayik is to remain in the Self.‘Bhagwan unge bhasheeyo, samayik arth,Samayik pun atma, the-re sidho arth.’‘The Lord has defined the meaning of samayik as: ‘Samayikis Atma and Atma is samayik.’* * * * *Aptavani-2339340Aptavani-2the seeker, is vikalpi (‘I am Chandulal’, he has ego because hedoes not have the knowledge of the Self), then how can one dodhyan?

You cannot obstruct the discharging ofthe mind. The Gnani Purush puts a stop to the charging of themind so then it is possible for the discharging mind to graduallydissolve. Nevertheless, this can only be done through theweapon of knowledge given by the Gnani Purush. The Gnanistoo have a mind. Even Lord Mahavir had a mind, but what kindof a relationship do they have with their minds? It is just like aman standing at the door shaking hand and receiving thewedding guests, one by one (He does not get stuck on oneguest). Gnani too observes the salute from each thought thatsprings forth when the tubers in the mind begin to sprout. He willacknowledge the thoughts one by one as they come forth. TheGnani maintains a relation of gnata-gneya (knower-object to beknown) with the thoughts; He does not become one with them.He does not get ‘married’ to them. Not having met a Gnani, hascaused one to have all kinds of thoughts and create tubers bybecoming engrossed in these thoughts, which give rise to morethoughts and the harassment continues ad infinitum. When youmeet a Gnani, He will show you how to dissolve those tubersand then they will melt away.Control over the mindQuestioner : How can we control the mind?Dadashri : The mind can never be controlled. The mindis completely physical, just like a machine. A person may thinkhe has succeeded in gaining control over his mind, but it is onlydue to an effect of his previous karmic account. Only if a personhas previously made the bhaav to do so, will the effect manifestin this life. Only previously made arrangements will bear fruits inthis life. Otherwise, it is not possible to bring the mind undercontrol. The mind cannot be tied down with anything. Just asyou need a vessel to contain and confine water, you need Gnanto confine the mind. The mind will only yield to a Gnani Purush.It is not to be fractured; it has to be dissolved. The mind is a‘boat’ in the ‘ocean of life’; you can only cross the ocean of lifeand reach ashore in this boat. The whole world is swimming inthe ocean of life. They swim a little but they sink, again theyswim and sink and come up also and that is why they get tired.Everyone has the desire to reach the shore in a boat, butbecause they do not have the right understanding, they try todestroy this boat of the mind. We need the mind; the mind isgneya (that to be known) and you are gnata-drashta (theknower and the seer) of it. The mind is a film; what will youwatch if there is no film? The mind is a film but because you donot know this, you become engrossed with it and say, “I havegood thoughts.” And you do not like it when you have badthoughts. Good thoughts sow seeds of attachment (raag) andbad thoughts sow seeds of abhorrence (dwesh). This is how theworldly life perpetuates. But when you meet a Gnani Purush andhe bestows upon you the divine vision (divyachakshu) whichwill give you awareness of the Self, then you will begin torecognize the tubers of the mind and they will dissolve as youcontinue to see them.Questioner : I have no interest left in the worldly life. Ido not like it anywhere, what should I do?Dadashri : When a person has a fever for several days,he does not feel like eating anything. He will even give it to youin writing, “I do not like eating anything”, but is he going to feelthis way forever? No! He will tear his note and say he was sickat the time he wrote it, but now he is fine. The mind changesevery moment. It will become interested again.

TheGnani maintains a relation of gnata-gneya (knower-object to beknown) with the thoughts; He does not become one with them.He does not get ‘married’ to them. Not having met a Gnani, hascaused one to have all kinds of thoughts and create tubers bybecoming engrossed in these thoughts, which give rise to morethoughts and the harassment continues ad infinitum. When youmeet a Gnani, He will show you how to dissolve those tubersand then they will melt away.Control over the mindQuestioner : How can we control the mind?Dadashri : The mind can never be controlled. The mindis completely physical, just like a machine. A person may thinkhe has succeeded in gaining control over his mind, but it is onlydue to an effect of his previous karmic account. Only if a personhas previously made the bhaav to do so, will the effect manifestin this life. Only previously made arrangements will bear fruits inthis life. Otherwise, it is not possible to bring the mind undercontrol. The mind cannot be tied down with anything. Just asyou need a vessel to contain and confine water, you need Gnanto confine the mind. The mind will only yield to a Gnani Purush.It is not to be fractured; it has to be dissolved. The mind is a‘boat’ in the ‘ocean of life’; you can only cross the ocean of lifeand reach ashore in this boat. The whole world is swimming inthe ocean of life. They swim a little but they sink, again theyswim and sink and come up also and that is why they get tired.Everyone has the desire to reach the shore in a boat, butbecause they do not have the right understanding, they try todestroy this boat of the mind. We need the mind; the mind isgneya (that to be known) and you are gnata-drashta (theknower and the seer) of it. The mind is a film; what will youwatch if there is no film? The mind is a film but because you donot know this, you become engrossed with it and say, “I havegood thoughts.” And you do not like it when you have badthoughts. Good thoughts sow seeds of attachment (raag) andbad thoughts sow seeds of abhorrence (dwesh). This is how theworldly life perpetuates. But when you meet a Gnani Purush andhe bestows upon you the divine vision (divyachakshu) whichwill give you awareness of the Self, then you will begin torecognize the tubers of the mind and they will dissolve as youcontinue to see them.Questioner : I have no interest left in the worldly life. Ido not like it anywhere, what should I do?Dadashri : When a person has a fever for several days,he does not feel like eating anything. He will even give it to youin writing, “I do not like eating anything”, but is he going to feelthis way forever? No! He will tear his note and say he was sickat the time he wrote it, but now he is fine. The mind changesevery moment. It will become interested again. Under certainconditions, people feel they do not like the worldly life; certainAptavani-2345346Aptavani-2conditions make them feel this way, but those conditions change.Tedium towards worldly life is attachment for itDadashri : Do you ever feel mentally and physically tired(kantado) of the worldly life?Questioner : Yes.Dadashri : That is attachment (raag). You feel that wayonly where there is attachment; it is dependent uponcircumstances. Kantado (mental and physical repulsion) is reallythoughts of the mind. You should tell these thoughts, “Come.Come. However many thoughts that want to come!” Thoughtsthat spring forth, come from the stock that exists in the mind andthey are discharging. When do they discharge completely? Theydischarge when You remain in the awareness of the Self butwhen you become engrossed (tanmayakar) with them, thenthose karmas become sticky and the thought will linger. Themind will show all kinds of things but You should not becomeone with it. You should remain just the observer of whatever ishappening.On one side arises dispassion (vairaag) and inevitably onthe other side there will arise attachment (raag) along with it. So,one has to investigate where the attachment is. When a persongets old (has dispassion due to the suffering of old age), he stillfeels it would be nice to live longer (raag for life). Is that underhis control? One simply has to know and observe all thedifferent kinds of thoughts that arise. Some will even see theirown death in their dreams! The world is completely different.There is nothing higher than attachment for a Gnani Purushand detachment from everything else. It can cure everything.What is the human form? It is worthy of worship even by theDevas; the celestial Gods. It is very rare even for the Devas toattain a human birth! Human birth is priceless provided oneattains full enlightenment. Enlightenment occurs when the diseasesof the mind go away. People cannot understand the diseases oftheir mind. They do not have an understanding of which part oftheir mind is diseased and which part is healthy. When the mindbecomes healthy, the speech becomes healthy and the bodybecomes healthy too.One uses meditation to still the mind when it becomesagitated and restless. That will help allay the disease ofrestlessness, but it will do nothing for liberation. Only when themind remains constantly under control, can it be consideredcured. Constant control means it will not go anywhere. The mindcan only be controlled through Gnan and only the Gnani Purushcan do that. In the absence of Gnan, wherever the mind goes,it gives rise to the worldly life. Even when a person goes to theHimalayas having renounced the worldly life, he grows a roseplant, raises a goat and starts a worldly life this way. He createsa crowd even in solitude.Nature of the mindWhat is the nature of the mind? When one says, “I amdepressed”, then the burden of the depression will increase tenfold. And when he says, “I am not depressed”, then the burdenreduces ten fold. If one feels he will not be able to fall asleepbecause of the noise from the radio, then he will definitely bebothered and stay awake. And if he feels, “I will be able tosleep”, then he will fall asleep nicely. This is how the world is.You are separate from the mind, the body and speech. If theneighbor (the non-self) is making noise while doing the dishes,who is going to tell him? If you were indeed one and the same(Chandulal), then you could tell him. You are simply the knowerof his activities.The mind is well within its own dharma (nature). Wouldthe mind be affected if no words were to enter the ears? Itwould have no effect. And what happens when words enter theears? It is the nature of the mind to analyze everything.

One should remain in one’sown inherent nature (swadharma), the Self.Questioner : We try very hard for peace of mind, but wecannot calm our minds.Dadashri : What religion do you practice?Questioner : Vaishnav.Dadashri : So then, is the Vaishnav religion wrong? No.Is Lord Krishna wrong?Questioner : No. The mistake is mine…Dadashri : What mistake is that?Questioner : Dada, you would know that.Dadashri : What is your name?Questioner : Chandulal.Dadashri : If you have about twenty-five rupees in yourpocket, your mind will remain still in the shops of the Bombaybazaar, but what if you had about twenty thousand? Would themind remain still? It is possible for the mind to remain still butyou keep spoiling it excessively. If you spoil your child too mucheveryday and then expect him to remain calm, he will not.Similarly, if you keep spoiling your mind and expect it to remaincalm, is it likely to do so? The mind has few needs, but here youspoil it by buying a radio, then a fridge, then a television. It willnot behave after you have spoilt it thus. Do not spoil the mind;you can spoil everything else. If you have spoilt your wife, theGnani will straighten her out within an hour. If your wife is actingup, you can move into another room and stay away from her fora day or so, but the mind is going to be with you day and night.A mind that is spoilt will not behave. However, when you meeta Gnani Purush and attain Gnan, then a mind that has goneastray will fall back on the right track.Questioner : I had toiled ten years for this, before I metyou, Dada.Dadashri : Did you not do the same in your past life?You have done the same thing for infinite past lives.

Is it in order to make everyone miserable?The Lord does not interfere in this at all; He does not put Hishand in this production. It is but natural and the Lord sittingwithin listens to all this; He even laughs, “Why is Chandulalbehaving like this?” We are all a part of the samsaran marg (thepath of spiritual and physical evolution).

Youare not the one attempting to control it; Chandulal is doing it. Itis possible to control the mind if You try, but you will have todecide who you really are, will you not?

How canatmaranjan be found anywhere outside of this satsang? One canattain it only if he comes here to the Gnani Purush. The momentone comes here, one can palpably feel, ‘now my time forliberation has come’ and that is why he is delighted. A prisonerwill be delighted if you tell him he will be released in a few dayseven though he remains in captivity. Similarly, here oneexperiences atmaranjan. Here, you have to listen to every wordvery carefully in minute detail. Even just one word of the Gnanican take you to moksha.Mind is the worldThis body has no real relation with the Self. The mind isthe whole world and that is why you feel pain when you hurtothers and pleasure when you make others happy. The mind isthe world. The mind will be pleased if you give pleasure toothers. When you make others happy, you will not receiveunhappiness even if you ask for it. The mind is the world; youget what you give. Kavi says, “Manmandir na anganiyamakalptaru ugiya re’, meaning, in the courtyard of the templehave grown, kalptaru (wishing tree); a tree with power tosatisfy all desires.” Therefore if you want worldly comforts, donot give others what you do not like yourself. Only you knowwhat you do not like, so do not give to others what you do notlike. There are many other pains beyond what you considerpainful, but there is no greater fool than you if you give to otherswhat you consider painful. Then how can you find pleasure? Isthere not a difference between giving knowingly and unknowingly?If a child breaks something valuable, is he likely to be asupset? And what if the father breaks it? The Father will beunhappy. So do not give to others what you consider painful,and then you will be happy. You do not need to read scripturesin order to be happy.Even the one who does not have Gnan would understandDadashri : The mind is a boat; it can take you to mokshaand it can also make you wander aimlessly in the worldly life.When can it take you to moksha? That boat will take you tomoksha when you meet a Gnani Purush, because until then theboat will not have a compass. Your mind becomes steady andpeaceful in His presence, so then imagine how wonderful andpeaceful His mind must be! The Gnani’s mind, intellect, chit andego are all wonderful. He has ego too, but his ego is wonderful,it is not a crazy ego. His ego is beautiful. If one human being hasthat much energy, then how much would another have? Thesame, however that energy has not manifested in you. When canit manifest? It can manifest only when one finds a savior; theGnani Purush.In Baroda a woman asked me, “Dada, all my life I havedone good to others and yet why do I not find any peace ofmind? Why do I still have so much inner turmoil and anguish nomatter how much I connect with God?” She asked me aquestion that is in my realm to answer. She asked a veryprofound question. People get caught up and lost in these twolanes of life. The lady had made a wonderful deduction indeed.All worldly religions entertain the mind (manoranjan),whereas, here with the Gnani Purush there is eternal bliss of theSelf (atmaranjan). In the former there is experience ofexcitement and pleasure, but not bliss. Where the mind settlesand becomes still that is the religion where one has to sit andlisten. What is the point of listening to the religion, which excitesthe mind and gives temporary pleasure; when it makes one feelgood transiently? It is only worthy if it produces even theslightest of change within (decrease in kashays). One haslistened to discourses and preachings in the Jain upashrayas allhis life of eighty years, and yet he experiences no change fromwithin, so what’s the use? That is called manoranjan; there is nostillness of the mind.

Happiness will follow for sureif he does just this much. Whatever effect one experiences isgoing to be experienced by the others also, is it not? If you donot perceive a good intent (bhaav) towards you, then do not letsuch intent which hurts others arise within you. How can youhurt others with what hurts you?ThoughtsWhat are thoughts? When a tuber in the mind sprouts, thesprouting is in the form of thoughts. You can read these thoughts.Thoughts make you get up, sit down, do this, do that, make yourun around. Such are thoughts. Thoughts that do not make oneget up, sit down, or run around are considered tamed thoughts.Thoughts that make you run around are not tamed.The entity that complains from within is the mind; it is thethoughts which speak from within, but these are thoughts thatyou have stored from the past life. There are many thoughts thatdo not arise within and that is because you have not storedthem. Only that which has been stored within will come out. Soonly the thoughts one has stored will shout and complain.Whatever one has stored has become established within; willthey not shout and complain?If a thought turns bad it will leave a stain behind so do notlet it become bad and tainted (do not support it), this is all thatyou have to understand. You have to be particularly careful inthis satsang that thoughts do not become bad. If the thoughtbecomes bad, everything will become bad. If you think you aregoing to fall then you will fall. Therefore, do pratikraman rightaway and come back to the Self. Our religion (Akram Vignan)says to look for the positive in the negative. At night if a thought‘this bed sheet is dirty,’ arises, then ‘we’ make an adjustmentright away by saying, “This bed sheet feels really smooth” andthe sleep then is very restful. Knowledge through the five sensesshows inconvenience and the knowledge of Self makes itconvenient. Therefore, remain as the Self.If your friend is sick, you have to tell him to seek medicaltreatment. You may even have thoughts that he is not going tomake it. Such thoughts will discourage you and make youemotionally weak; they are not helpful. These thoughts are thecause of the worldly life. By nature, thoughts are impatient andunsteady but You should not become impatient and unsteadyalong with them. They will keep on coming, and when they do,you have to remain the knower and the perceiver of thesethoughts. The Self is present when you know your thoughts. Yousimply have to know that first Chandulal passed away, and thenChaturlal passed away, that is all.Questioner : Many thoughts come, but it is later that Irealize that they were only thoughts; does that mean I becameengrossed (tanmayakar) with the thoughts?Dadashri : If you do not get involved with the thoughts,then the Self remains the Self. At times when many thoughtscome all at once, the awareness is not present but when yourealize later on that the thoughts had engulfed you, that in itselfshows that the Self is present.After Self-realization, the force of thoughts do not causeany harm. The only problem is that they obstruct the bliss of theSelf.How many children come running together out of theschool when it ends?

One has to understand all this in precise detailAptavani-2353354Aptavani-2from the Gnani Purush, so that one will not encounter anyproblems later.Influx and discharge of thoughtsIf too many thoughts arise within and one remainsengrossed in them, then it causes inflow of karma (ashrav)which creates bondage (bandha). If one remains the knower-seer (gnata-drashta) of the thoughts, then the karma willdischarge (nirjara) and there is blockage against an inflow(samvar) of new karmic matter. Everyone has thoughts. Tubersof thoughts that one has interest in can explode like untimelybombs. They may do so even at three in the morning, and somemay even wake you up before they sprout. Even with dreams,no matter what, you will be awakened first. It all takes place ina sequence. When the circumstance is right and the tuber ofsomething you like sprouts, and when you ‘read’ it and becomeone with it, then karmas will bind you. However, if you read itbut let it pass, it will not come back again. Thoughts come fromthe mind and they are completely separate from You, but youbecome one with them (tanmayakar). Atmadharma is to remainas the Self and not become one with the thoughts. Tubers ofthoughts sprout when circumstances arise. These tubers can beof greed or sex and they can be small or large; there are allkinds of tubers. Those in which you have an undue interest willbe large and will produce many thoughts. You have to keep‘observing’ them if you want to dissolve them. These arethoughts, which are possible to read. One remains tanmayakarwith thoughts he likes and when unpleasant thoughts arise itinstantly becomes evident that he is separate from them.Clean mind in unpleasant situationsWhen all that is unpleasant, is tolerated by a clean mindthen one will become a vitarag.Questioner : What is a clean mind?Dadashri : A clean mind is to not have any negativethoughts about the other person. It means not to attack the nimit(the person instrumental in the discharging of one’s karma,unfolding in this life). The mind is cleansed when a negativethought is washed off with instant pratikraman.Questioner : A clean mind is the ultimate stage, is it not?And until one reaches that stage of absolute cleanliness, he hasto keep doing pratikraman, does he not?Dadashri : Yes, that is true. But the mind can be cleanin some aspects and not in others; these are stepping-stones.Pratikraman is needed where it is still dirty.‘We’ used to think about the meaning of every word inthis world, from the very beginning. ‘We’ did not have Gnan inthe beginning, but ‘we’ had the highest level of intellectualdevelopment (vipulmati), whereby the moment something wassaid, ‘we’ would immediately have an accurate assessment of itfrom all perspectives. The minute anything was discussed, ‘we’would have an instant analysis and understanding of the essenceof whatever was being discussed. That is called vipulmati. Noone has this quality and the fact that it has happened ‘here’ isan exception. Where can you find vipulmati in the world? It iswhere one adjusts everywhere. Here in worldly matters, ‘oneboils what is to be eaten raw (salad), and cuts for salad whatis to be boiled (potato).’ How will this help in adjusting? Onehas to adjust everywhere.Who inspires action ?Questioner : Who or what is the inspiration behind anaction?Dadashri : Inspiration is the effect of the causes of pastlife. Inspiration comes from thoughts of the mind. Whateveractivity one carries out, it is not done by the Self. It is pratishthitatma, the relative self or the charged self, created from the pastAptavani-2353354Aptavani-2from the Gnani Purush, so that one will not encounter anyproblems later.Influx and discharge of thoughtsIf too many thoughts arise within and one remainsengrossed in them, then it causes inflow of karma (ashrav)which creates bondage (bandha). If one remains the knower-seer (gnata-drashta) of the thoughts, then the karma willdischarge (nirjara) and there is blockage against an inflow(samvar) of new karmic matter. Everyone has thoughts. Tubersof thoughts that one has interest in can explode like untimelybombs. They may do so even at three in the morning, and somemay even wake you up before they sprout. Even with dreams,no matter what, you will be awakened first. It all takes place ina sequence. When the circumstance is right and the tuber ofsomething you like sprouts, and when you ‘read’ it and becomeone with it, then karmas will bind you.

Support the goodthoughts that are beneficial and reject; ‘do not support’ the onesthat are bad and not beneficial. If you support the negativethoughts, they will take hold within.

Thestatement, ‘I had a thought’ itself proves that ‘I’ and ‘thoughts’are separate. One says, “I am having a thought,” or, “These aremy thoughts.” Therefore, thoughts are completely separate fromthe Self.

Otherwise, theentanglements of karma will not fall away in the presence of thebuddhi. Buddhi will continue to do its work but one does nothave to use it. If there is a snake and one uses the light of thebuddhi there, he will become very restless. But vyavasthit (partof Gnan) says ‘Carry on, nothing is going to bite you’ and hencehe remains unaffected (nirakudata).

What ‘we’ are saying is, after acquiring the fulllight of the Self, turn off the light of the buddhi. Just as peoplehave concern about wasting electricity, we should be concernedabout wasting away the light of our Self by using the buddhi.Whenever we use the light of the buddhi, we waste and weakenthe main energy, the light of the Self. And when you stop usingthe light of the buddhi, the light of the Self will increase andbecome more effulgent.Questioner : The light of the buddhi will always remain,will it not?Dadashri : Yes buddhi will present itself for help when itis needed, but you don’t have to keep its switch pressed on allthe time. It will come on automatically. The switch should notremain in the on position. The buddhi shows you where thebenefits of worldly comforts lie. Buddhi is used in every worldlyactivity (of the non-self), whereas, ‘I am Shuddhatma’ is use ofGnan.The Self is in its natural and spontaneous state, but it canremain that way only when the prakruti i.e. the non-self alsobecomes natural and spontaneous. When can prakruti becomenatural and spontaneous? It will become natural when buddhitakes a break. You needed buddhi when you were studying incollege, but now that you have completed college, do you needit? Now you can tell ‘he’ to stay at home because you do notneed her anymore. Just retire her. Buddhi makes you unsettledand that is why you do not experience the bliss of naturalnessand spontaneity of the Self. Only the non-self is unsettled but ifyou put buddhi aside, then you will experience the natural bliss.When you see a dog, the buddhi will tell you, ‘This dog lookslike the dog that bit someone yesterday. What if it bites me too?’What control does the buddhi have? The dog will bite you if thatis in your vyavasthit. Indeed if anything were under one’scontrol, would people not do everything positive for themselves?But that does not happen. The buddhi makes one suspicious and(ashuddha and ashubha meaning impure intellect that whichbinds demerit karmas), avyabhicharini buddhi (that whichbinds merit karma) and samyak buddhi (right buddhi whichleads towards the Self). In any one of these three states, if aperson has had the ‘darshan’ of an enlightened being (jina), thensamyak buddhi will arise within him. If he has done darshan ofthe pure enlightened one, and he places his faith there, thatcausal seed will not go unrewarded, leading to samyak buddhiwhich finds the path of liberation very easily.A grocer gets in a dispute with one of his customers fornot paying him 2000 Rupees; in the altercation the customerslaps him. The matter goes all the way to a court. Here, he hasnot been paid yet and there is a court case. He keeps saying,“I am very unhappy. This whole mess has made me verymiserable.” He has invited all this misery upon himself! Nomisery will visit anyone, if it is not invited. Miseries arise becauseof the viparit buddhi. Viparit buddhi is like cutting vegetableswith the wrong side of the blade; the vegetables will not cut andyour finger will bleed.The one who is clever, over wise (akkal) will not achievemoksha. The one whom the world considers as very clever isreally very dumb and stupid (from the perspective of liberation).The one with cleverness digs his own grave. That is what ‘we’call stupidity. ‘We’ are without any intellect or akkal. ‘We’ areabuddha. If ‘We’ had a slightest of buddhi, it will give rise to allkinds of interference and dhyans, and in our business ‘we’would feel, ‘He charged me too much. He did this and he didthat.’ It would destroy Gnan altogether.Limit to using buddhiWe were sitting at Dadar station at seven o’clock in themorning when all of a sudden all the lights went out, so one manwith buddhi asks, “Why did they turn off the lights?” Well!

Only the non-self is unsettled but ifyou put buddhi aside, then you will experience the natural bliss.When you see a dog, the buddhi will tell you, ‘This dog lookslike the dog that bit someone yesterday. What if it bites me too?’What control does the buddhi have? The dog will bite you if thatis in your vyavasthit. Indeed if anything were under one’scontrol, would people not do everything positive for themselves?But that does not happen. The buddhi makes one suspicious and(ashuddha and ashubha meaning impure intellect that whichbinds demerit karmas), avyabhicharini buddhi (that whichbinds merit karma) and samyak buddhi (right buddhi whichleads towards the Self). In any one of these three states, if aperson has had the ‘darshan’ of an enlightened being (jina), thensamyak buddhi will arise within him. If he has done darshan ofthe pure enlightened one, and he places his faith there, thatcausal seed will not go unrewarded, leading to samyak buddhiwhich finds the path of liberation very easily.A grocer gets in a dispute with one of his customers fornot paying him 2000 Rupees; in the altercation the customerslaps him. The matter goes all the way to a court. Here, he hasnot been paid yet and there is a court case. He keeps saying,“I am very unhappy. This whole mess has made me verymiserable.” He has invited all this misery upon himself! Nomisery will visit anyone, if it is not invited. Miseries arise becauseof the viparit buddhi. Viparit buddhi is like cutting vegetableswith the wrong side of the blade; the vegetables will not cut andyour finger will bleed.The one who is clever, over wise (akkal) will not achievemoksha. The one whom the world considers as very clever isreally very dumb and stupid (from the perspective of liberation).The one with cleverness digs his own grave. That is what ‘we’call stupidity. ‘We’ are without any intellect or akkal. ‘We’ areabuddha. If ‘We’ had a slightest of buddhi, it will give rise to allkinds of interference and dhyans, and in our business ‘we’would feel, ‘He charged me too much. He did this and he didthat.’ It would destroy Gnan altogether.Limit to using buddhiWe were sitting at Dadar station at seven o’clock in themorning when all of a sudden all the lights went out, so one manwith buddhi asks, “Why did they turn off the lights?” Well! Whatdo you need lights for when you have the light from the rays ofAptavani-2363364Aptavani-2suspicion causes interference and creates negative karmas. Youshould remain in your non-suspecting state of the Self. Theworld will constantly remain in a state of suspicion (shanka).Excess intellect is harmfulQuestioner : Dada, how can one decrease buddhi?Dadashri : You need the power of samyak (right kind)buddhi to reduce it.Memory increases as buddhi increases and so does innerturmoil. Buddhi is to be set aside and must never be heeded. Ifthere is one person in your vicinity that has caused problems foryou because you listened to him, then how long will you go onlistening to him? You may listen to him once or twice but thenyou will not accept anything he tells you. Buddhi makes yousensitive; it makes you emotional, so how can you accept it?In your worldly interactions, one should have enoughwisdom to ensure that no one is harmed and that overwiseness(akkal) is unnecessary. If a person becomes over wise, he willlose his mind; he becomes stupid. So he should not be overwise, excess buddhi should be removed. He needs to be wisebut not over-wise. When he becomes over-wise, he will start tocheat and trick others. When he tricks someone he is using hishigher intellect to take advantage of those with lesser intellect.Then what is the difference between you and a crook? Trickingpeople is even more harmful than stealing from them. It carriesa greater liability as compared to stealing. The Lord has said,“You will become merciless if you continue taking advantage ofpeople through your intellect.” It is better to hurt peoplephysically because some day you may even feel pity for theperson you hurt. Everyone in the world uses their intellect to hurtothers. It is considered the worst raudradhyan. The consequencesof this will be a life in hell. Raudradhyan means to deprive othersof their happiness or to hurt others by any means. When you sellsomeone less fabric than what they pay for, by stretching it asyou measure it, it is considered raudradhyan. Because theintention behind it is to sell people short so you can have extramaterial left over. If you are to get 9999 Rupees, then that is allyou will get with or without raudradhyan. On the contrary youruin your dhyan by stretching the fabric and saying, “I have tomake money somehow!” People do not have faith that moneywill come to them. You have started your business on faith sodo not ruin your state (the dhyan) on that faith, and have truston the faith that money will come.Everyone in the world moves around in blind faith; peopleeven drive cars in blind faith. When a Gnani Purush sits in thecar, he knows that the car may or may not have an accident;whatever will be, will be. It is possible to move about in blindfaith, even if one does not have Gnan.Buddhi makes you wander in the worldly lifeThe one who is intrinsically inclined to wander will meetthe one who will make him wander. Those who make otherswander will pay a higher price because they use their higherintellect to take advantage of them. The intellect is to be used forlooking for ways to help people, but instead people misuse theirintellect. Such intellect is vyabhicharini buddhi. Lord Krishna hasreferred to it as ‘vyabhicharini buddhi’, in the Gita. There is noneed to do anything through the intellect. The world is such thateverything can be done effortlessly. People do not know how,otherwise it is possible to enjoy everything in this human life.Humans cannot enjoy the world and neither can the animals thatcome into contact with them; the animals too suffer along withthe humans. There are millions and millions of other embodiedsouls (jivas) but only the humans have suffering because theyhave misused everything; the mind, the intellect etc. Only humanbeings are independent and without support (nirashrit; theybelieve themselves to be the independent doers).

Do youkeep your chit in place when you eat? What is the cause of highblood pressure? It is because you eat without the presence ofyour chit.” The poor Sheth became humbled and put his headin my lap and said, “Yes Dada, I have never eaten with my chitin my food.”What did Lord Krishna say? He said, “Enjoy what is infront of you and do not worry about what is not.” When thereis food in front of you, eat peacefully with your chit in the food.It will taste very good if your chit is present. You would notenjoy even a thirty-two course meal if your chit is absent. If yougive this body only a small amount of rice, it will be contentwhole night. But instead what people do is their body eats at thetable but mentally they are in their factories or their places ofbusiness. Then they have heart attacks. Their hearts fail! Theydidn’t fail at school, but they fail here!Observe the animals when they eat to see if their chit iswandering around. A dog wags his tail with excitement when heis eating. All animals eat in the presence of their chit but whenthese sheths, doctors, lawyers eat; they eat in the absence oftheir chit. That is why they have problems of high blood pressureand heart attacks. High blood pressure and heart attack is aconsequence of an absent chit. The blood vessels become hardbecause of this. What would become of a patient if the doctor’schit were absent while he was performing a surgery? There areendless operations going on within while eating, and thereforeeat with your chit focused on the food. Check to see if your chitis present while you are eating by asking, “Are you present?”There will come a time when even the doctor’s chit willwander.

It is the fear of making such mistakes that thedoctor’s chit remains focused on what he is doing.It may not be possible to have your chit in everything youdo, and that is fine, but it must be present when you eat.Questioner : Dada is it like the saying, ‘Work while youwork and play while you play?’Dadashri : That saying is meant for the foreigners whoare natural and spontaneous, not for vikalpi (where there isexcessive interference of intellect) people like the Indians!

To bring downhis ego, the Gnani guru told the son, “Go to King Janak toreceive spiritual instructions.” The Muni-ascetic son went toKing Janak. Gurudev had already forewarned King Janak. Asthe Muni entered King Janak’s palace, he saw a wealthy displayof grandeur and magnificence. King Janak was sitting on a swingof gold, with his arm around his queens seated on both sides. Heseemed to be enjoying their company. When the Muni saw this,he thought to himself, ‘What kind of spiritual instructions cananyone receive from such a pleasure-seeking person like thisking?’ But out of respect for his father’s instructions he did notsay a word and followed the King’s every instructions. The Kingserved him a thirty-two course meal on dishes of gold. As theMuni sat down to eat he happened to look up. He was shockedby what he saw. There was a huge bell hanging directly abovehis head, and it appeared that the bell could fall any moment.The King had deliberately hung the bell above the Muni’s head.The bell was suspended by a thin and transparent rope. TheMuni became so anxious that he ate as quickly as he could. Ashe ate, the King coaxed him into enjoying the food and eatingmore, but the munis’ chit was stuck on the bell hanging over him,all the while wondering what would happen if the bell were tofall upon him. After he was done with the meal, as the Kingserved him after-meal refreshments, he asked, “Maharaj howwas your food? What did you like the most?” The Muni was avery honest man; those who practice penance are not deceitful,they only have a problem of the ego. He told the king the truth,“Your honor, May I tell you the truth? My chit was stuck in fear,on the bell hanging above my head, and so I don’t even knowwhat I ate!” That is when Janak Videhi said, “Maharaj, your chitwas not present on what you were eating.

Should one not keep an eye on whereand when the chit goes?‘We’ salute those whose chit never goes anywhere.Dada’s chit never goes anywhere and that is called freedom.Liberation is synonymous with the liberation from the wanderingchit.From infinite chit to one chitHere in the satsang, why do we tell everyone to singKavi’s pados (spiritual songs about the Soul)? Because for theduration of time they sing, their chit becomes ek-chit i.e.concentrated and focused in only one place. The whole worldis absorbed in endless chit, including the ascetics, the monks etc.When you sing these pados in my presence, your chit remainshere, concentrated in one place. The concentrated chit will notdissipate in different directions. The whole world is trying hardto focus the chit at one location so it will not wander, but no onecan. One can only achieve that when the chit becomes pure(shuddha). The chit can only become pure when one meets aGnani.There are three types of worldly chit:1. ‘Anant chit’ (endless or infinite chit). There is nostability in this chit whatsoever.2. ‘Anek chit’ (many different chit). There is stability inthis chit which is why one can go to temples and derasars.3. ‘Ek chit’ (one chit; concentrated or focused in onlyone place). One is eternally blessed when this happens.Questioner : Dada, is the soul (atma) the same as theSupreme Soul (parmatma)?Dadashri : When one has the experience of the Self(Atma), as the supreme Self (parmatma) then he indeed is thesupreme Self, and when he has the experience of Shuddhatma,then he is Shuddhatma. And, the worldly people have theexperience of being the worldly self (muddhatma). ‘This is myuncle, this is my aunt, this is my mother-in-law’s aunt’s son etc,’is anant-chit. It is because of the anant-chit that one canremember all these. He is exact and precise in knowing all theserelationships and yet he has no knowledge of who he really is.When he knows this i.e. when he knows his real Self; after Self-realization, he becomes liberated.When ‘Dada’ comes in your dreams it means that the chithas become ek-chit at that time. Generally people have noconcept of the chit; instead they play a tug-of-war with theirminds. This worldly life has arisen because of the chit. People’schit has spilt everywhere. Their chit has been caught up ininnumerable locations.Questioner : How did the chit arise?Dadashri : When one sees an object (gneya) with thelight of the buddhi, the impure chit sees the object by theprocess of taking on the form of the object being seen (tobecome gneyakar). That chit can see the tables and the chairsat home, but it cannot see the Shuddhatma (the Self).Questioner : Is chit dictated by karma?Dadashri : Yes, but if the chit becomes still then it isgood. Otherwise, one is trapped if it gets stuck somewhere. Itwill remain stuck there, no matter how hard the mind tries todivert it to get it unstuck. As it is the anant-chit already exists butit is very difficult to bring it into anek-chit. One’s work will bedone when the chit becomes ‘ek-chit’. This is possible with ourGnan.From anant-chit to anek-chit means that one can keep aAptavani-2371372Aptavani-2Questioner : Never, Dada.Dadashri : If the chit remains present then energies willincrease tremendously. Should one not keep an eye on whereand when the chit goes?‘We’ salute those whose chit never goes anywhere.Dada’s chit never goes anywhere and that is called freedom.Liberation is synonymous with the liberation from the wanderingchit.From infinite chit to one chitHere in the satsang, why do we tell everyone to singKavi’s pados (spiritual songs about the Soul)? Because for theduration of time they sing, their chit becomes ek-chit i.e.concentrated and focused in only one place. The whole worldis absorbed in endless chit, including the ascetics, the monks etc.When you sing these pados in my presence, your chit remainshere, concentrated in one place. The concentrated chit will notdissipate in different directions. The whole world is trying hardto focus the chit at one location so it will not wander, but no onecan. One can only achieve that when the chit becomes pure(shuddha). The chit can only become pure when one meets aGnani.There are three types of worldly chit:1. ‘Anant chit’ (endless or infinite chit). There is nostability in this chit whatsoever.2. ‘Anek chit’ (many different chit). There is stability inthis chit which is why one can go to temples and derasars.3. ‘Ek chit’ (one chit; concentrated or focused in onlyone place). One is eternally blessed when this happens.Questioner : Dada, is the soul (atma) the same as theSupreme Soul (parmatma)?Dadashri : When one has the experience of the Self(Atma), as the supreme Self (parmatma) then he indeed is thesupreme Self, and when he has the experience of Shuddhatma,then he is Shuddhatma.

Is the mind superior to chit?Dadashri : No, all are independent. There are nothoughts in chit and the chit is not in thoughts. Man will die if themind leaves the body. It is the chit that wanders off.Questioner : Why does the chit wander?Dadashri : The chit wanders because it is searching forhappiness. The senses are under the influence of the mind. Theword ‘chetan’ comes from the word ‘chit’. Chit means gnan anddarshan i.e. knowledge and vision respectively. You are sitting insatsang here, and a blurry vision of the table in your office iscalled darshan and a clear vision of that table is called gnan. Thechit goes out there and sees it. When you can see things ingeneral, the chit is in the form of darshan and when you seethings in details, the chit is in the form of gnan.You become what you contemplate on. If a collegegraduate spends all his time tending to bullocks in the farm, hewill become like one because the bullocks become the subjectof his contemplation (niddidhyasan). Therefore, if youcontemplate on whatever you encounter, you will become likethe object of your contemplation.The chit is a fraction of chaitanya (pure consciousness).The chaitanya comprises of chit.Only the chit becomes stuckQuestioner : Is the chit more powerful than the mind?Dadashri : The mind cannot leave the body. The chit cango out side and it also works within the body. If your shoulderhurts, it will keep going there; it will go wherever you want totrack of, and count the places where the chit wanders. Samayikof forty-eight minutes means a change in the wandering of thechit. The chit can begin to be contained starting from eightminutes to forty-eight minutes. It begins to be contained (stopswandering) after eight minutes. When you make ice-cream, themilk (anant chit) gels (anek chit) first then the ice-cream beginsto form (ek chit). Amidst all this when the ‘Dada’ comes in thedream, what does it mean? One has attained the ‘reel (film)’ ofthe chit in his hands. This is the experience of the Self. Thenone’s work is done. This is the darshan of ‘Dada’.Pure chit : Impure chitQuestioner : How can one make the chit stay at homeand not wander out?Dadashri : The chit will only come to its natural home,the Self, when it becomes pure. What is the first impurity of thechit? ‘I am Chandulal’, ‘I am young’, ‘I am her husband’ etc.are all impurities of the chit. From this one can realize that theparmanus of the chit are scattered everywhere and todaypeople’s chit have even become double-chit (be-chit). Thosewith double chit will see everything double. One man told me,“I am going away to purify my chit.” If you go to a silversmith,he can do silver plating for you. But if you want to purify yourchit and you go to someone with be-chit, he will turn your chitinto be-chit too! Instead, it is better you leave things the waythey are. Then the one with double chit will say, “I can see twooil lamps (where there is one)!” Arey! You must have achievedsalvation! How can you see two when there is only one?The best solution for purifying chit is direct satsang ofDada. Chit is constantly purified here. It is not appropriate,when Dada is sitting here and you try to purify your chit at yourhome.Why is the impure chit impure? It is because it cannot seeAptavani-2373374Aptavani-2the Self; it can only see the non-self, whereas the pure chit cansee both the Self and the non-self.Questioner : If the mind tells the chit not to wander, willit?

When mosquitoes bite you on your leg, let them, thereis no problem if you withdraw your chit from there. Besides themosquitoes will only bite if you have a karmic debt with them.What is the nature of the chit? Once you withdraw it from acertain location it will not remember that place. The Self (Soul)exists in all parts of the body except the hair and the nails, butif you pull your chit away, then no messages can be forwardedto the ‘head office’. The message only reaches the head office dueto the presence of the chit; only then will the ‘Deputy Superintendentof the Police (the one who follows the orders of the Self)’ cometo investigate. If a mosquito bites you on your hand, your chitwill go there. Loosing a hundred thousand or making a hundredthousand is like these mosquitoes that come and go.If a man is very hungry is he likely to be staring at clothesin a cloth shop? No, he will look for a food store. If a hungryman steps out of his house, he will look for food. A woman,hungry for a sari, will seek out a sari shop one way or the other.When the body is not hungry, the mind will become hungry.When neither the body nor the mind is hungry, there will be ahunger for speech. When one says, “I will not rest until I tellhim”, that is hunger for speech. If you are eating and a beggarpasses by, the old people used to say, “Be careful, that he doesnot cast an evil eye (najar) on you.” Now what is this ‘najar’that they talk about? It means that the chit becomes stuck inanything that one is hungry for. If a woman is hungry for aparticular man, her chit will get stuck in that man and vice versa.Everything has been ruined by casting such ‘najar’.If a baby is very cute, the parents will put a little blackspot on his face or his forehead in order to avoid someonecasting an evil eye (najar) on the child. A person’s chit is likelyto get stuck if he is hungry for a baby, will it not? The black spoton the face is to divert the chit’s focus away from the face.Only the Gnani Purush is untouched by najar. Whenevera person stares at the Gnani, the Gnani immediately sees the Selfwithin that person. All the machinery within is like telepathy; ifthe Self gets involved in it, everything will be ruined.If one’s chit is relatively pure, then when he studies, he willremember everything he reads just once. The intention ofstudying is to attain purity of the chit in the relative sphere.Only the purity of chit is importantOne will remember what he reads only if his chit is presentwhen he reads. When I was young, I used to study without thepresence of the chit. Is that why I failed? No, I did not fail, butI was called dumb. As such I was brilliant. I told the teacher,“Sir, I spent fifteen years trying to learn one language, but hadI spent those fifteen years searching for God, I would havedefinitely found Him by now.” The prime years of my life werewasted in learning one language, which even a young child couldlearn. But the teacher did not understand that.Questioner : Is chit the main component of theantahkaran? Is chit not the leader that drags the rest of themdown? Which needs to be controlled, the chit or the mind? Whydo people forget the chit and go after the mind?Dadashri : What you are saying is true. Even the Gnanishave given importance to the chit but people do not knowanything about the chit or the mind. They think the mind and thechit are the same. The chit does not remain in one place and themind keeps showing pamphlets, but people do not know whichthe chit is and which the mind is.The chit however, will not roam during satsang. Chit is therelative self. When the chit becomes still, so will the relative atmaand Dada has given you the Self. When both, the relative andthe real Self sit still next to each other, then one experiencesnothing but liberation (moksha). This is exactly why you have tosit in the satsang. Otherwise, there are many parks and gardens,but when you sit in satsang, the chit remains steady and the atmaAptavani-2375376Aptavani-2send it.

Otherwise, there are many parks and gardens,but when you sit in satsang, the chit remains steady and the atmaAptavani-2377378Aptavani-2(relative atma) becomes still and serene. This is the power ofcompany of like minded people (sangh), is it not? Nothing isaccomplished without such a group. You need the power ofsuch a group and when such energy (power) exists in a groupthere will be no discord due to difference of opinion. That is whyLord Mahavir associated with many people. The more thepeople, the greater the energy of the group (sangh) and the morethe soul becomes settled and still. If there are only three people,then the company will be three strong; the more people, thestronger and greater the company. An hour of this satsang hastremendous value.The purpose of bells in temples is to steady the chit. Whydo they use aangi; the silver plating over the idols of God? Whydo they have all kinds of decoration for God? Why do they havearomatic incense and candles? These are all tools to help holdthe chit in the right place. When the bells ring, they drown alloutside noises. But the ‘smart’ ones will have their chit on theirshoes outside the temple when they are doing darshan of theLord inside the temple! You fools! Just be mindful of vyavasthit!A person will only take your shoes if they are meant to be his(due only to accounts of karma) and if he does; he will takethem only once. Is he likely to take them every time? So let himtake them, at least your karmic debt will be paid off.The worldly life is a disease of sort. This disease will beallayed and lessen for the duration of time you forget about it.The more you forget about it, the more you will be rid of it. Thatis the law. The worldly life disease, increases as the chit wandersaround. There is no instrument to make this worldly diseaseleave. The Gnani Purush is the only instrument.At night, whatever you make the pure chit do; it willcontinue to do just that whole night long and you will haveblissful sleep. When ‘we’ are doing a vidhi at night and ‘we’happen to doze off, the vidhi continues from where ‘we’ left(dozed) off when ‘we’ wake up. And if ‘we’ doze off again, thesame thing happens again and the vidhi will end in the morning.If you capture the pure chit in this way, it will last till the morning.‘Miracles’ of the chitQuestioner : I see a flash of light for a fraction of asecond when I am doing my prayers. Is this the light of the Self?Dadashri : That flash of light you see is a sensory play;it is a phenomenon of the chit. The chit becomes still when one’sfaith sets in it. The light of the Self is not something you canimagine, even if you want to. When someone tells me, “I can seeLord Mahavir,” I tell him, “What you are seeing is the idol thatyou have seen before. What you are seeing is the scene, thetarget; the object (drashya). What you need to do is to look forthe seer (drashta). Keep the vision (drashti) in the seer(drashta) and keep the knowledge (gnan) in the knower(gnata), then your work will be accomplished.”Questioner : What is soundless sound (anahat naad)?Dadashri : It is the concentration of the chit whereverthere is a pulsating sound within the body.They do the same in kundalini yoga, but one cannot getmoksha by doing that. You will encounter so many such stationson the way to moksha. But your work will be done when youarrive at the final station. There is nothing but chit chamatkar inthe practice of kundalini yoga but it has nothing to do with theSoul. The Jains say, “there is no liberation without theknowledge of the Soul.’ The followers of the Vedanta too, saythe same thing. And anahat naad is a sound; it is the sound inand of the body. There is no Soul in it!Some say, “I can see Lord Krishna within”; that is chitchamatkar, there is no Soul in that. The one seeing Krishna is theSoul. Ultimately the drashti has to fall on the drashta, i.e. thevision has to fall on the one seeing. Instead, people focus onwhat is being seen. In anahat naad and other such practices, theAptavani-2377378Aptavani-2(relative atma) becomes still and serene. This is the power ofcompany of like minded people (sangh), is it not?

Only when the drashti fallson the drashta (the Self, seer) and gnan on the gnata (knower),is your work accomplished. The attributes of Soul are to seeand to know. Many say, “God gives me darshan from within.”Is that darshan a darshan of Yogeshwar Krishna? How can youhave that darshan? That darshan stems only from what you havealready seen and you have seen Lord Krishna only in pictures!The knowledge of, ‘Who am I?’ is ‘I am Shuddhatma (Iam a pure Soul)’. When this knowledge is attained, you attainthe knowledge of the Knower and only then there will be nomore vikalp (‘I am Chandulal’). Vikalp – ‘I’ in the wrong place,will remain as long as Gnan does not fall into the knower (I amthe Soul) and sankalp – my or mine, remains as long as thevision (drashti) does not fall in the seer (drashta).* * * * *Ego : AhamkarIf a train is stuck, some foolish one will comment, “Therailway people are useless. They should all be fired!” You foolishpeople, who are you condemning? The workers and the trainare both vitarags (they are impartial). Nevertheless, the ego willnot refrain from playing its role. We have become free from allsuch misunderstanding after Gnan. Outside there are storms ofmisunderstanding. When the gutters become full with water,people complain and curse the employees of the municipality,“You people do not clean out the gutters!”If a housewife buys lentils, which do not cook well, shecurses the grocer and if it comes to her mind, she will even cursethe farmers! She attacks so many people this way. If you tell herto check with the neighbor, she will find that her neighbor doesnot have any problems with her lentils! However, she has a habitof attacking and accusing people. If her cooking turns out good,she will tell everyone in the house. That is ego. Attacking is alsoego. This ego says, “I am something.” If you ask, “What areyou?” She will say, “I don’t exactly know, but I know I amsomething!”At Diwali the host serves snacks with good intent (bhaav)but a guest may say with resentment, “I don’t care for this. Idon’t like it”; that is an ugly ego. On this auspicious day ofDiwali, if he takes just a small amount of that snack, he will nothurt the host. Then his ego will appear good. ‘We’ would drinkeven poison if it was served to ‘us’ with good intention. Yes,‘we’ have solutions for everything.What is Akram Gnani?

We have become free from allsuch misunderstanding after Gnan. Outside there are storms ofmisunderstanding. When the gutters become full with water,people complain and curse the employees of the municipality,“You people do not clean out the gutters!”If a housewife buys lentils, which do not cook well, shecurses the grocer and if it comes to her mind, she will even cursethe farmers! She attacks so many people this way. If you tell herto check with the neighbor, she will find that her neighbor doesnot have any problems with her lentils! However, she has a habitof attacking and accusing people. If her cooking turns out good,she will tell everyone in the house. That is ego. Attacking is alsoego. This ego says, “I am something.” If you ask, “What areyou?” She will say, “I don’t exactly know, but I know I amsomething!”At Diwali the host serves snacks with good intent (bhaav)but a guest may say with resentment, “I don’t care for this. Idon’t like it”; that is an ugly ego. On this auspicious day ofDiwali, if he takes just a small amount of that snack, he will nothurt the host. Then his ego will appear good. ‘We’ would drinkeven poison if it was served to ‘us’ with good intention. Yes,‘we’ have solutions for everything.What is Akram Gnani? Akram Gnani’s ego is veryAptavani-2381382Aptavani-2pleasant and wonderful. He would sit with you but He wouldalso sit with the lowest of people. He would not look ugly or outof place anywhere. He would always look wonderful. Gnanis ofthe Kramic path however, will not visit those who are inferior tothem. They will say, “I will do whatever I have to but I will notgo there.” Their ego is ugly.All you have to care for is make sure that the ego appearsbeautiful. How beautiful is Dada’s ego when He comes here.Your ego too, should look just like His and then you will seewhat a wonderful state that is!Ego in the Kramic path and Akram pathWhat is the Kramic path? In this path one is told: ‘Purifythe ego.’ In this path one has to purify the ego that has becomeexcessive. So he has to purify the ego gradually, a little at a time.And when the ego becomes completely pure then only he attainsthe Self. The unnatural (vibhavik) ego expresses as pride, deceit,hypocrisy, arrogance etc. These are all different forms of ego. Aperson may be earning a minimum wage but he walks around infancy clothes. So people will comment, “He is a phony.” Hewalks around pompously. It’s like a fox dressed up in tiger’sskin. Arrogant people do not have respect for others. Theydisplay arrogance and scorn in everything they do. If someoneasks a man’s wife what he is like, she’ll say, “He is of no useat all.” There are all unnatural forms of ego. You have to get ridof all of them. There are many difficulties in the Kramic path.One is doomed if he happens to meet with temptation on thispath. Our Akram path does not have such dangers. It is a pathwith security. It is a secure path. There is no problem even if youhappen to meet people who tempt you on the way. The otherperson will become confused but you will not be affected.In the Akram path, the ego that remains is the discharging(nikali) ego, whereas the ego in the Kramic path says ‘I haveto do this. I have to renounce this, etc.’ therefore this ego is acharge ego. Here, in the Akram path, the ego is discharge ego.The ego in the Kramic path binds karmas because the seekerbelieves he has renounced: ‘I have renounced this. I still need torenounce that…’ The fact is his renunciation is the effect of hisprevious life’s ego but by believing and saying this, he chargesnew karma. The Gnani Purush eliminates that which bindskarmas. It is that simple! It is straightforward. If you go on theKramic path, they will take away your hair! (The ceremony ofplucking hair upon initiation on the path of renunciation). Andhere you are free to keep not only your hair but all yourpossessions!This ego has created nothing but a mess. You can undothe mess and accomplish your goal by surrendering to the Gnani.A wise ego will not try to enforce its own wisdom whereas afoolish ego will criticize everything. Therefore, you eitherunderstand this fact or remain obedient and submissive to theGnani. Man does not have the power it takes to comply with afoolish ego, so the best way then is to remain under the guidanceof a Gnani Purush with humility. The foolish ego is sounpredictable that it will listen to the Gnani for thirty days andwill discard his words and instructions on the thirty first day! Thesicker the ego, the greater is the problem. There is no way outother than to surrender to the Gnani.After receiving Gnan from ‘us’, everyone still has the ego,but it is the discharging ego; it is nikali ego. What is the nikaliego like? It will comply. It will listen to You; it is not the foolishego.Foolish, mad EgoYou can tell the foolish ego, “Do you get any respect?Why are you being egotistical? You do not have 1300 queens,do you? You have no wealth or property, do you? So, what isit that makes you so foolish?”A person has an ego of ‘I am something!’ Yes, but what?Aptavani-2381382Aptavani-2pleasant and wonderful.

When you look at all thestages of spiritual development, starting from the first through thetwelfth, you will understand that the ego has caused nothing butmisery. Such an ego is a mad ego. It makes a person believe heis superior and yet others around him will not think so. That isa mad ego; it is an ugly ego. The Chakravarti emperors used tohave an ego too, but it was a malleable ego. One could moldit anyway one wanted. People accept such ego; it is a wise ego,whereas the other is mad and foolish ego. We can ask this ego,“When have you ever been at peace?”Where will you find people who are thrilled to see youand welcome you warmly telling you they could not do withoutyou?

But when others give you Gnan, theAptavani-2385386Aptavani-2intoxication will arise and the feeling of ‘I am something’ willalways remain. It will even remain during sleep. That is why theLord had said, “Any gnan or scripture that causes intoxicationis agnan (ignorance).” Atmagnan is different in every person, butonly the Atmagnan of the vitarag will not cause intoxication. Onthe contrary, the speech of the vitarag reduces intoxication. Herepeople tell you ‘Do it this way and that way. Renounce this. Dopenance etc.’, this causes tremendous intoxication. It is good fora life in the celestial world, but not for liberation. ‘Our’ speechwill reduce intoxication and the big toe of ‘Our’ foot (surrenderat the feet of the Gnani) is the only ‘solvent’ in this world thatwill dissolve your ego.Questioner : Can the ego be dissolved?Dadashri : Yes, ‘Our’ speech is such that it will dissolvethe ego. It dissolves anger, pride, deceit and greed. A Shethcame to ‘us’ in Ahmedabad and told us, “Take away my angerfrom me.” So ‘We’ did. The Gnani Purush has everything todissolve anything.What is the support of anger, pride, deceit and greed?What supports them? People say, “I get angry. This happens tome. That happens to me?” When they say, ‘it happens to me’,that is the support behind the kashays. They support the kashaysby saying ‘it is happening to me’, which is why the kashaysremain. Everything dissolves when the Gnani Purush takes awaythat support. It is not possible to reduce anger gradually, besidesif the anger goes down, then pride will increase on the otherside. People go around without any idea of their real Self, theyhave no idea of who they are and then they take theresponsibility on to themselves. They continue to suffer theworldly life without the awareness of who they really are.Three keys to becoming happyIn short, the (wrong belief) of ‘I am Chandubhai,’ (aropitbhaav) is egoism. Use that egoism positively if you want worldlycomforts; do not do anything negative in it. If you want onlymiseries, then maintain a negative ego and if you want a mixtureof happiness and misery, then do positive and negative together.But if you want liberation, free yourself from the wrong beliefand come into the nature of the Self (swa-bhaav). The wholeworld revolves around these three statements. You are incompliance with the dictates of every religion if you understandthese three statements and abide by them.Therefore there are only these three statements:1. Have a positive ego to be happy. Positive ego is theego of not hurting any living being, in the slightest degree.2. Negative ego is the cause of unhappiness and misery.If someone insults you and you harbor animosity and enmitytowards that person, then it is a negative ego. If you complainto the authorities about someone who he is hoarding goodsillegally in his home, you are avenging yourself. You fool! Youhad that man arrested because of your animosity? Just forvengeance! This is a negative ego.3. Become free from the false projection (aropit bhaav) ofSelf on the worldly self (I am Chandulal) if you want liberation.Negative ego is a bad thing. The moment you look tosend someone to jail, you are imprisoning yourself. Your thinkingshould be that whatever comes your way, it comes to youbecause of your past mistakes so accept it and ‘deposit’ it intoyour karmic account.

And yet just lookat how complicated this world has become. Who are yoursuperiors? There are only two: your own mistakes and your ownblunder. What is the blunder? The blunder is to claim to be whatyou are not. To say ‘I am Chandulal’, is a blunder because inreality you are a pure Soul. When the blunder is removed, whatremains? When someone insults you, can you not understandthat it is the consequence of your past mistake? Therefore youhave to deal with all situations with equanimity.What happens if you drink a nice cup of tea after eatingsweets? The tea will taste bland; you will not be able to taste thesugar in it.

Whateveranuvrat one has attained is the distance he has covered inanuvrat, however he still has to cover the distance whereby hewill attain complete conformity to the mahavrat too, will he not?Then he will have a glimpse of the Soul. After completion of thefive major vows, he will get the glimpse of the energy of the Self(atma shakti). Upon attaining of five mahavrats, only thepratyakhyani kashays remain. Pratyakhyani kashays are faultsfor which pratyakhyan i.e. the resolve to never repeat themistakes are on going. The rest of the kashays become light andwill eventually cease to exist; the Lord has referred to these aspratyakhyan avaran (a veil that remains due to the need tocontinue pratyakhyan). What do ‘we’ call it? ‘We’ call it thenature of the habits of the mind, body and speech. By whateverdegree the nature of these habits dissolve, that much of it is goneand the rest remain. What does the pratyakhyan-avaran state?It states that ‘You have done many rituals of pacchakhaan(making a firm decision) still the veil of ignorance remains(avaran). And so you will have to do pacchakhaan for theignorance.’ There may be one or two such faults but at least youdon’t have the faults of your entire life! Samkit; the state of Self-realization, the state of right vision is a different state altogether.There is no such thing as samkit in penance, renunciation etc.The mahavrat itself is samkit; it is a state where there is naturalconformity to the mahavrat.Do all renunciants not also practice these vows? They do,but do their minds not remain uncontained? And because theirmind remains uncontained, their kashays (anger, pride, deceitand greed) are openly evident to all. When the kashays are notvisibly evident, we know that they are in a state ofpratyakhyanavaran. Pratyakhyanavaran kashaya means thatkashays are not visible to others. The kashays have become sothin and light that one cannot see them, despite their existence.Nevertheless, kashays have their effect within. These kashaysbring forth effect, which only the ascetic suffer and no one elsearound him.The kashays that one can see in the renunciants andascetics should not be there. However, because their kashayscan be seen on the outside, one can deduce that not only dothey not have conformity to mahavrat for sure, but they are non-compliant even in their anuvrat! True anuvrat is where anacharya (spiritual master) has such an aura of power that no onewill lie to him. But here his disciples lie to him and he tells lieshimself, so where is his anuvrat of speaking only the truth? Themahavrats have gone to the vitarag lords, but today there is notrace of anuvrats either! Vitarag Lords say, “The losses youincur will be yours. We are not going to lose anything.” Vitaragsdo not incur a loss, do they? The loss is to the one who doesnot abide by the Lord’s instructions. Loss is to those who do notdo as the Lord tells them. Don’t people look like they just drankcastor oil? Where did all their happiness vanish? The Soul isthere, so should the bliss not be there too?‘We’ are not criticizing anyone here. ‘We’ never criticizeanyone. ‘We’ are just explaining the facts. If someone understandsthis from ‘us’ and tells ‘us’, “You are right, you are stating thefacts”, then his work will be achieved. That person will quicklyfind the path to liberation. And if he says, “What you are sayingis wrong”, then his current wandering will continue. What is it to‘us’? If you want to curse someone four times over and you canafford to do so, then do it; ‘we’ have no objection. ‘We’ justwant to tell you the facts as they are: You are taking on a greatliability. If you carry on this way, you are going to fall into a deephole. That is what ‘we’ are telling you. Hear me out if it suitsyou, if not then you can curse me and move on.The vitarag did not say such things. ‘We’ speak this wayAptavani-2389390Aptavani-2‘We’ have natural conformity with all the mahavrats. ‘We’eat, drink, and live a worldly life and yet ‘we’ are in the stateof complete conformity with the five major vows. Whateveranuvrat one has attained is the distance he has covered inanuvrat, however he still has to cover the distance whereby hewill attain complete conformity to the mahavrat too, will he not?Then he will have a glimpse of the Soul. After completion of thefive major vows, he will get the glimpse of the energy of the Self(atma shakti). Upon attaining of five mahavrats, only thepratyakhyani kashays remain. Pratyakhyani kashays are faultsfor which pratyakhyan i.e. the resolve to never repeat themistakes are on going. The rest of the kashays become light andwill eventually cease to exist; the Lord has referred to these aspratyakhyan avaran (a veil that remains due to the need tocontinue pratyakhyan). What do ‘we’ call it? ‘We’ call it thenature of the habits of the mind, body and speech. By whateverdegree the nature of these habits dissolve, that much of it is goneand the rest remain. What does the pratyakhyan-avaran state?It states that ‘You have done many rituals of pacchakhaan(making a firm decision) still the veil of ignorance remains(avaran). And so you will have to do pacchakhaan for theignorance.’ There may be one or two such faults but at least youdon’t have the faults of your entire life! Samkit; the state of Self-realization, the state of right vision is a different state altogether.There is no such thing as samkit in penance, renunciation etc.The mahavrat itself is samkit; it is a state where there is naturalconformity to the mahavrat.Do all renunciants not also practice these vows? They do,but do their minds not remain uncontained? And because theirmind remains uncontained, their kashays (anger, pride, deceitand greed) are openly evident to all. When the kashays are notvisibly evident, we know that they are in a state ofpratyakhyanavaran. Pratyakhyanavaran kashaya means thatkashays are not visible to others. The kashays have become sothin and light that one cannot see them, despite their existence.Nevertheless, kashays have their effect within. These kashaysbring forth effect, which only the ascetic suffer and no one elsearound him.The kashays that one can see in the renunciants andascetics should not be there. However, because their kashayscan be seen on the outside, one can deduce that not only dothey not have conformity to mahavrat for sure, but they are non-compliant even in their anuvrat! True anuvrat is where anacharya (spiritual master) has such an aura of power that no onewill lie to him. But here his disciples lie to him and he tells lieshimself, so where is his anuvrat of speaking only the truth?

You arrive at the station and ask someonewhere you are. They tell you, you are in Miami. You ask themwhen the train will arrive at New York and they tell you thatNew York is in the opposite direction. This is how it is forpeople who are on the wrong path to moksha. The path ofliberation is not like this. The path of liberation is not laden withphysical suffering and misery (kasht). There is no moksha wherethere is kasht (subjecting body to penance) and where there isliberation, there is no kasht. The Lord considers kasht a form ofobstinacy (hathagraha). What do the renunciants and asceticson the path of liberation today claim? They say, “The Lord tooendured physical suffering!” You fools! Why do you disgrace theLord in this way? How can the Lord be so? Even this ‘Dada’does not subject his body to any punishment so why wouldLord Mahavir do so? Gnanis never subject themselves toausterities (kasht). People say that the Lord renounced theworld. You fools! He renounced the world at the age of 30years after he had a child and he did so without hurting his wifeand children. When the Lord went to his elder brother forpermission, his brother told him to wait for two years. The Lordwaited for two years and then, with the consent of his wife, herenounced the worldly life. The Lord did not have to renounceanything; His renunciation was natural and spontaneous as aneffect in his life on earth. Renunciation was his natural state. Thisis because the Lord was in mahavrat. Mahavrat means thatwhich is part of one’s state. He did not have to renounceanything. If he ‘did’ renounce then that would not have countedas a vrat (vow). There is a big difference between undergoingthe act of renunciation and renunciation being an integral part ofone’s conduct. The two are completely different. A person, forwhom renunciation is inherent in his conduct, will not evenremember what he renounced.The current ascetics, who renounce, keep track of all thethings they leave behind. They will tell you, “I have left behindthree children, a wife, huge homes, and enormous wealth.’ Theyare aware of all they leave behind. How can you say they haverenounced when they cannot even forget what they haverenounced? The Lord considers that which one forgets naturallyas vrat, not renouncing (tyaga). There is anuvrat and there ismahavrat. He has said for the Jains to do anuvrat. Whateverbecomes an integral part of one’s conduct is the same as havingcome into anuvrat. When a person renounces the worldly life, hewill have the intoxication of the ego (keyf) of having renouncedand whatever he renounced will always remain on his mind: ‘Irenounced so much. I renounced this way and that way.’ He canonly find a solution to this entanglement if he understands all this.‘We’ never remember any such things.

If renunciation of smokingcigarettes was truly for you, you would not even think aboutthem, whereas the one who has to renounce smoking, will keepremembering, ‘I have renounced smoking. I have renouncedsmoking.’ Therefore renunciation which is natural is completelydifferent; there, there is no ego of renouncing. However, manyexpress ego about their renunciation. You fools! Now thatrenunciation has become natural and spontaneous, wise up!Why must you go around bragging about it? Why are you beingarrogant about it? Renunciation that is spontaneous is a goodthing. The more one gets rid of his worldly possessions, thelesser the baggage and hassle on the path of moksha. And whatis our path of liberation like? Because this path is the Akrampath, we leave alone the old karmic baggage (from past life).We do not touch them; we simply do not create any new ones.You do not have to get rid of the old stock; it will fall away onits own when it is time for it to leave.One maharaj (Jain priest) made his own discovery: Hesaid, “Akram is really akarmi (this word has two very differentmeanings 1. Useless (general term) 2. One that does not bindkarma (spiritual form)), is it not?” Yes his discovery is good; thescientists too make discoveries, do they not? To make such adiscovery is a task fit for a scientist, is it not? Besides, akarmimeans one who does not bind karma; that is what he called ‘us’.He is saying a positive thing about ‘us’, is he not? He is notinsulting ‘us’, is he?To claim, ‘I am panch-mahavrat-dhari (the one whoupholds the five mahavrats)’ is a false support; it is an ego-based wrong belief. One has never inquired whether these fivemahavrats are resting on the foundation of ego. If you maharaj,are resting on the foundation of ego, then the great vows areresting on the same foundation, are they not? He replies, “I hadnever thought it that way.” And just because you have notthought about it in this way does not mean that Lord Mahaviris going to be fooled or that this path to liberation can be fooled.Is the Lord likely to be fooled? Many claim, “We arepanchmahavratdhari”, and people believe them because peoplecare about money and sex and nothing else. They have noawareness of what anuvrat, mahavrat or aropit bhaav is. Andpeople like us who know, will not say anything because it iswrong to speak against what is contrary to people’s belief.What is contrary to worldly belief? It is that which iscontrary to the prevailing system of worldly interactions. It is notright to establish a system of panchayat (five respected villageelders that adjudicate) in a village of thieves. If your pocket ispicked in such a village and you tell the people, “I was robbed”,they will say, “How do we know? Let us go to the panchayat.”But the panchayat too is made up of thieves. So you should notspeak against the people. If someone asks you then only youmay say, “This is an ego based (aropit) panchmahavratdhari(follower of the five great vows).

The mahavrat ofparigraha (the supreme vow of non-possession), is a very highstate indeed. ‘Dada’ is free from all possessions; non-acquisitiveness (aparigrahi); He is completely aparigrahi. Hedoes not have a single parigraha in his mind; not a singleparigraha occupies his awareness. He is not even aware of anyparigraha missing or present. Whereas these ascetics have onlyfour possessions; two items of clothing, a bowl for food, arosary and a pair of tongs. And if the bowl were to break, theyget very upset. Then you had better watch out! You are introuble. Or if one of their possessions is not found in its place,they will demand, “Where did it go?” So they have that muchparigraha in them; it remains in their awareness. They have onlythe four items in their possession and yet they remain in theirawareness. Whereas despite living amidst abundance of materialthings, nothing remains in ‘our’ awareness, and that is why ‘we’are considered aparigrahi. Our mahatmas have the awareness ofbeing the pure Soul. Therefore, they take possession and theygive their possession and yet they are considered aparigrahi.This is because parigraha is not in their awareness. Theirawareness is that of being the pure Soul. One can have eitherthe awareness of the Pure Soul or the worldly life. One can haveonly one or the other. That is the science.Many people in the world do not steal overtly. However,the Lord does not consider that as tyagi (renunciation) of thevow of non-stealing. The Lord says, ‘That is your vow”; it is apart of your being (vartey tey vrat). That in which one does nothave a feeling of ‘I-ness’, and where one does not feel, ‘I amrenouncing’ and that which is natural to one, then it is called vrat(vow). Why is it that the Lord directed the anuvrats (minorvows) for the Jains? Because even people in foreign countrieshave anuvrat and also different religions here too have anuvrat.However, these vrats do not have the seal of approval by thevitarag Lords. When people gain the understanding that this vratis one given by the vitarag Lords, that vrat falls in theirexperience and conduct and therefore it is called anuvrat andthis is acceptable to the vitarag Lords. In reality even otherpeople do not steal either, but this non-stealing is a naturalconduct for them. Here one is easily aware that one should notsteal, then why is it still considered a minor vow (anuvrat)? Hemay not steal overtly but he steals a lot through his mind; thatis why it is called anuvrat. And what is the definition ofmahavrat?

They do not tellbig lies but they tell many little ones. Today however, everythinghas turned rotten; including the mahavrat. So have anuvrats!They used to be good at one time, but what can anyone donow? Nevertheless, it is all due to circumstances. Today entireHindustan is in ruins, is it not? Otherwise it can never be likethis. However, no one is guilty because it has been ruined dueto circumstances.* * * * *Alochana – Pratikraman – PratyakhyanAlochana means to confess of your mistakes exactly asthey are to a trustworthy person (aptajana). It is a confessionof mistakes in front of the Gnani Purush. Alochana will erase themistake entirely. Alochana alone can lead you to moksha. If aperson steals, but comes to me and confesses, I will do a vidhi(special spiritual energies invoked by the Gnani Purush) for him,then that mistake will be erased and he will no longer feel theburden of his wrongdoing. You can do alochana in front ofanyone whom you trust completely; otherwise, this world is suchthat people will misuse that information. If someone places trustin you, then you should strive to be one hundred percenttrustworthy. Do not break that trust. Really, alochana can onlybe done in front of the trustworthy Gnani Purush. The Lord hasplaced a lot of importance on alochana, pratikraman andpratyakhyan.Pratyakhyan is to make a firm decision not to repeat thesame mistake again.This incident took place about fifteen years ago inMamani Poda (place in Vadodara where Dadashri used to live).A few of us were sitting and talking when we saw a bewilderedlooking 78-year-old man running towards the derasar (Jaintemple); he had a small container in his hands. I asked him,“Uncle, where are you going?” He replied, “Brother, to dopadakmanu.” I asked him, “What is padakmanu?” He told me,“Wait! I will ask the maharaj (Jain priest) and let you knowtomorrow!”The Lord knew that a strange and peculiar time wasAptavani-2397398Aptavani-2is considered compliance of the mahavrat of non-stealing; itdoes not matter whether one is an ascetic, a renunciant or amarried man, they are all worldly people.People of ethics and high moral values do not steal; theyare not devious and they do not cheat people. They do not tellbig lies but they tell many little ones. Today however, everythinghas turned rotten; including the mahavrat. So have anuvrats!They used to be good at one time, but what can anyone donow? Nevertheless, it is all due to circumstances. Today entireHindustan is in ruins, is it not? Otherwise it can never be likethis. However, no one is guilty because it has been ruined dueto circumstances.* * * * *Alochana – Pratikraman – PratyakhyanAlochana means to confess of your mistakes exactly asthey are to a trustworthy person (aptajana). It is a confessionof mistakes in front of the Gnani Purush. Alochana will erase themistake entirely. Alochana alone can lead you to moksha. If aperson steals, but comes to me and confesses, I will do a vidhi(special spiritual energies invoked by the Gnani Purush) for him,then that mistake will be erased and he will no longer feel theburden of his wrongdoing. You can do alochana in front ofanyone whom you trust completely; otherwise, this world is suchthat people will misuse that information. If someone places trustin you, then you should strive to be one hundred percenttrustworthy. Do not break that trust. Really, alochana can onlybe done in front of the trustworthy Gnani Purush.

As long as they occur naturally andspontaneously, it is kraman but when an action becomesexcessive and hurtful, it is atikraman. For all the atikraman thatoccur, one will have to do pratikraman without fail if he wantsto be free. It will become clean only if he washes it off.If in the past life, one had created an intent ‘I want to slapthat man’, in this life when that intent materializes, he will end upslapping someone. That is atikraman, and for that he has to dopratikraman. Recall the pure Soul within that person and ask forforgiveness. The Lord has said, “You will attain moksha if youdo pratikraman for all your atikraman.”Any negative conduct is atikraman. A negative conduct isa stain (karmic stain) that will ‘bite’ you in your mind; in orderto get rid of it, you have to do pratikraman. If you commitatikraman towards someone, you have to do pratikraman wholeday, in his name. Only then will you be free. If both you and theother person do pratikraman towards each other, then youbecome free sooner. The pratikraman comes to end sooner ifyou both do five thousand pratikramans each. If the otherperson does no pratikraman, you will have to do ten thousandpratikramans if you really want to be free. At least you willbecome free; however, because there is only one-sidedpratikraman, the other person will continue to feel the hurthimself. Through your pratikraman, the other person will changehis feeling (bhaav) towards you. Not only will you improve yourown bhaav, but it will also positively influence the other person’sbhaav. There is so much power in pratikraman that even tigersturn into dogs (they become tame)! When is pratikraman useful?It is only useful in the wake of negative results or effects. If atiger is in its den and you do pratikraman sitting in your home,then pratikraman is not very useful, but if you come face to facewith a tiger that wants to eat you and you do pratikraman, it willtruly give results. The tiger will become like a lamb at that verymoment.Pratikramans being done today are mainly dravyapratikraman; the act of pratikraman is effect i.e. unfolding of pastkarma. Dravya (effect) pratikraman means your ‘clothes’ (therelative self), becomes clean but not the owner of the next life(the cause has not been washed). If Chandulal were to keeprepeating, ‘Chandulal eat rice and lentils. Chandulal eat rice andlentils…’ does that mean Chandulal has eaten? No, nothinghappens by simply speaking. Let me explain to you what dravyapratikraman is. Say Lord Mahavir bought a big bar of soap toclean his dirty clothes. He soaked the clothes first, and then hescrubbed them with the bar of soap and washed them in water.Now, how is the dirt on your clothes going to wash away by yousimply reciting the process of how the Lord cleaned his clothesfor one hour once a year? Allya! The Lord’s stains and hisprocess of washing were different and your stains and yourprocess of washing are different. Now if you simply keepreciting the Lord’s method, how are you going to be clean? Yourplight is like that of a bull in an oil mill; no matter how much thebull walks, he remains in the same place in the oil mill. Youratikraman will be washed only if you do pratikraman themoment any atikraman occurs. How can you remember youratikraman if you do pratikraman once a year? The current timeis so strange that people cannot even remember what they ateone hour ago, so how are they to remember their atikraman?Pratikraman has to be done on the spot, the instant theatikraman occurs. It needs to be ‘cash’; not pending as abalance.If you spill tea on your clothes, you get up right away towash off the stains and yet when your ‘self’ becomes stained,Aptavani-2399400Aptavani-2descending upon earth; hence He gave people the mightyweapons of alochana, pratikraman and pratyakhyan.What is pratikraman?All natural and spontaneous actions that take place in theworldly life are kraman.

That is whythese clothes (non-self) have become clean and I am helping youattain the same.There are two kinds of alochana, pratikraman andpratyakhyan. One is the kind done by worldly people, sadhus,ascetics and alike. This pratikraman helps cut down on the‘stickiness’ of the karmic tubers. However, the reward is muchgreater if pratikraman is done instantly, the moment atikramanoccurs. The latter is the kind of pratikraman done by ourmahatmas; they are done while being the Self.Wonder of Gautam Swami’s pratikraman !Do you think we had such pratikramans when the Lordwas walking around on this earth? What can we even say aboutthose times? A lay devotee of the Lord by the name of AnandShravak attained avadhi gnan (knowledge beyond the senses).When Gautam Swami went to him, Anand Shravak told him, “Ihave attained avadhi gnan.” Gautam Swami did not believe him,so he told the shravak, “This claim of yours is wrong so pleasedo pratikraman for it.” Anand Shravak asked, “Should I dopratikraman for telling the truth or telling a lie?” Gautam Swamireplied, “Pratikraman has to be done for telling lies. You do notneed to do pratikraman for telling the truth.” So Anand Shravaktold him, “If there is no need to do pratikraman for the truth,then I do not have the right to do pratikraman.” Gautam Swamiwent to Lord Mahavir and asked, “Dear Lord, does AnandShravak not have a right to do pratikraman?” The Lord said,“Gautam, Anand is right. He has attained avadhi gnan, so yougo and do pratikraman of Anand Shravak.” Gautam Swami ranto Anand Shravak and did pratikraman.Pratikraman has to be done for all inappropriate worldlyinteraction.Questioner : Dada, we are Jains and therefore we knowabout samayik (introspective meditation) and pratikraman, butwe are not able to do them, why is that?Dadashri : In this world, everything that can be followedor carried out is knowledge (gnan) and that which cannot befollowed or carried out is ignorance (agnan). When you say,“We understand samayik but we are not able to do it,” to thisthe Lord says, “You are ridiculing me.” If a bottle of poison issitting next to another bottle but you do not have knowledge ofthis, you are likely to take the bottle of poison. But here youhave the knowledge and still you are not doing it. That is anexcuse; you are claiming ignorance as knowledge. It is ignorancethat you call knowledge. No one would jump into a well onpurpose. The result of knowing is to stop (virati). If a child asksyou, “What is poison?” You tell him, “A person can die if hedrinks it.” Then the child will ask, “What is dying?” So youexplain to him, “That is what happened to the uncle next door;he died after drinking poison.” Then the child will understand.He will know that he cannot touch it because it is poisonous.Then he will put a stop to touching the poison.

Lord Mahavir did use theAptavani-2403404Aptavani-2language the people are employing today. He gave properinstructions, but people interpreted them according to their ownunderstanding. The Lord had said, “Understand correctly inyour own language.” He had said for us to use the ‘soap’ (dopratikraman) for cleansing away the stains (any wrong doing).But here people buy the soap, but they simply keep reciting thepratikraman ritually. No one is applying the soap to clean theirclothes and yet they claim they are doing pratikraman. Whenthey are finished with reciting their pratikraman, they go out andstart gossiping. Pratikraman should be instant. Pratikramanshould be done the moment atikraman occurs. Cash! Bodilyactivities are instant. Brushing teeth, drinking tea and eatingbreakfast are prompt activities; it is like cash in hand. Similarly,the activity of speech and mind are also ‘cash’; they areinstantaneous. So should be the pratikraman for any atikraman.Pratikraman should be done the moment any atikraman occurs,this way everything will begin to purify. If you do pratikramanthe moment atikraman occurs, the mind and speech will begin topurify.People do not understand what atikraman is and neitherdo they understand pratikraman. Once a year they do genericand collective ‘micchami dookadam’ (forgive my transgressions),without understanding what ‘micchami’ or ‘dookadam’ means.Pratikraman sessions today are conducted in the Magadhilanguage. The Maharaj reads and everyone listens, so how is thechit likely to be contained? People are likely to becomeinterested if they understand what the Maharaj is reading. Butpeople don’t understand it and then later they start gossiping.The Lord did not tell one to behave in this manner. What Hesaid was, “if you stumble, then realize that you must have erredand therefore immediately do alochana (confession of misdeeds)to your Guru or with me as your witness.” This pratikraman hasto be done directly, immediately and on a one-on-one basis;only then will you be able to wash away the mistake, just as youare quick to wash the stains on your clothes, to prevent it fromsetting in. Human beings are like this, if they spill tea on theirclothes, they will rush to wash off the stain, whereas they haveno care about washing off the stains that have tainted their mindsfrom countless past lives. Pratikraman should be a cashbusiness; nothing should be left pending. Why is it that people’s‘clothes’ remain dirty despite doing pratikraman every day? Isit because they do not have the right soap, or their clothes arethe wrong kind, or the water is dirty? Why else would theirclothes not become clean if they wash them everyday? It isbecause no one can see their own faults, so how can they dopratikraman? Our mahatmas do two hundred to five hundredpratikramans everyday and wash off their faults. One can go tomoksha in two hours if he has five hundred thousand faults left,but if you ask these people, they will claim they have only twoor three faults!Questioner : Is it true that one has to go to a religiousplace to do pratikraman?Dadashri : You can do pratikraman even while drinkingtea or taking a bath. One has to be concerned about location ifhe is involved in worldly religious practices of the body, the mindor the intellect (deha-dharma, mano-dharma and buddhi-dharma). However, ours is the religion of the Soul (Atmadharma)and therefore we are not concerned with the physical body, soyou are free to do pratikraman anywhere you like.Many consider bathing is the only religion. That is whytheir religion has not progressed further. Those who are involvedin deha-dharma have large quantities of parmanu of attachmentin them and if someone were to insult them, they will see thatperson as a culprit and regard him one hundred percent guilty.In the same situation, a person with greater spiritual developmentwill accept that the fault lies in his own karma.

Do pratikraman of whomever you rememberbecause you know that the real within that person is eternal, theSelf never dies. Doing pratikraman will help his soul and you willbecome free from your karmic entanglements with that person.Questioner : How do we do pratikraman for the dead?Dadashri : You have to recall the pure Soul that isseparate from his mind, body, speech, bhavkarma (chargekarma), dravyakarma (effect karma), nokarma (neutral karma),his name and all the attachments associated with the name of thedead. Then recall all the mistakes you made (alochana) and say,“I am repenting for those mistakes and asking for forgiveness(pratikraman). I am making a firm decision not to repeat thosemistakes (pratyakhyan).” ‘You’; the Self should remain theknower and the observer of ‘Chandulal’ (non-self) doing thepratikraman and know how many pratikraman he does and howwell he does them.Where there is constant pratikraman, there the self isverily pure (shuddha). You should ‘see’ the pure Soul in othersand do pratikraman; at that time your awareness of your ownpure Soul prevails. This pratikraman is not a worldly ritual.Purification of many other things occurs simultaneously.What does the relative non-self (pudgal) say? It says that‘you’ have become ‘pure’, but now make me ‘pure’. When theimpure pudgal parmanus express i.e. when mistakes occur thenpratikraman will make them pure, (correct the mistake).Gross and subtle (sthool and sookshma) mistakes arecorrected through pratikraman and the subtler and the subtlestmistakes (sookshmatar and sookshmatam) mistakes are correctedthrough ‘seeing’ them. This path is the path of alochana,pratikraman and pratyakhyan and in addition, they must be donethe instant the mistakes occur.

Whereas here, our law says ‘The fault is of thesufferer’.What are the results of pratikraman ?Questioner : How can we do pratikraman if we havecontinued attraction (asakti) for someone?Dadashri : By saying the name of that person, recallingthe Soul within that person and recalling ‘Dada’, do pratikramanfor that attraction.Questioner : What should we do if someone hasnegative feelings towards us?Dadashri : You still have to do pratikraman. It is becauseof your prior mistake that the other person feels that way aboutyou. You are bound by your own mistakes. Bondage can be dueto either attachment or abhorrence (raag or dwesh); you have todo pratikraman for whichever it is. If the other person is simpleand straightforward, ask for forgiveness directly from him.Otherwise, you can do it in your mind and that will still clearyour karmic debt.Questioner : Does pratikraman turn the other person’smind completely?Dadashri : If pratikraman is towards a completestranger, he will be overcome with awe. He will be drawntowards you right away. Pratikraman will pacify the otherperson’s tendencies (vrutti). However, as far as your familymembers are concerned, you will constantly have to do theirpratikraman.Questioner : If we keep remembering someone who hasdied, do we still have to do his pratikraman?Dadashri : The dead as well as the living will come intoAptavani-2405406Aptavani-2your memory. Do pratikraman of whomever you rememberbecause you know that the real within that person is eternal, theSelf never dies.

Bondage can be dueto either attachment or abhorrence (raag or dwesh); you have todo pratikraman for whichever it is. If the other person is simpleand straightforward, ask for forgiveness directly from him.Otherwise, you can do it in your mind and that will still clearyour karmic debt.Questioner : Does pratikraman turn the other person’smind completely?Dadashri : If pratikraman is towards a completestranger, he will be overcome with awe. He will be drawntowards you right away. Pratikraman will pacify the otherperson’s tendencies (vrutti). However, as far as your familymembers are concerned, you will constantly have to do theirpratikraman.Questioner : If we keep remembering someone who hasdied, do we still have to do his pratikraman?Dadashri : The dead as well as the living will come intoAptavani-2407408Aptavani-2cannot get moksha on credit.One has to do pratikraman and pratyakhyan for anyatikraman done through the mind, body and speech.

The external gross himsa may or maynot have any consequences but it is the inner intent that dictatesthe consequences of the actions. The inner intent has directbearing upon how the karma is bound, and hence this violence(himsa) has to be washed for sure. Atikraman is violence. Howcan people do pratikraman when they do not even understandwhat himsa is? What kind of pratikraman will they do? If grossor overt acts of himsa were considered himsa, then EmperorBharat would have never attained moksha. How many peopledid he kill during the battles? Gross himsa is not an obstacle forliberation. It is the subtle himsa (bhaav himsa i.e. the inner intent)that obstructs moksha.I have given the mahatmas something very special in theirhands. People will have to accept that despite their actions offighting physically on the outside, their inner right vision (samkit)never leaves. There is a distinct and separate line of demarcationbetween the streams of the Self and the non-self.As for you (Dadashri addressing the seeker who has notattained Self-realization) there is no separation. Without alochana,pratikraman and pratyakhyan, the two streams cannot remainseparate. There is constant alochana, pratikraman andpratyakhyan in the mahatmas. What is this like? As their externalactivities are going on, the internal activity of alochana,pratikraman and pratyakhyan are also going on simultaneously.This should be going on constantly. Do you do alochana,pratikraman and pratyakhyan?Questioner : Yes. I do pratikraman yearly (samvatsari).Dadashri : Let me explain how you should do yourpratikraman. Do you have a guru?Questioner : No I do not.Dadashri : If one happens to quarrel, it is because of hisunfolding karma and the tendency of his prakruti (the relativeself), but when this happens, he needs to recall his guru, recallthe Soul within the person he has hurt and do pratikramanimmediately. Atikraman is an act of aggression. If one doesatikraman with his boss, there too he can erase everything if hedoes alochana, pratikraman and pratyakhyan, using his guru asthe witness. When he does this, instead of creating a tight solidknot of karma through the atikraman, it becomes loose and itwill disintegrate upon the slightest touch in his next life.

The only way to become free isthrough pratikraman and pratyakhyan, there is no other way.Atikraman and aakraman (excess atikraman) causes bondage.The subtraction (pratikraman) must equal the addition (atikraman)in order to zero out everything.

Aakraman carries tremendous liability. A simplenegative thought is atikraman but an inner intent of, ‘I will set himstraight. Whatever may happen to me but I will take care of him’is aakraman bhaav (hostile or attacking nature). Aakramanbhaav does not remain after Self-realization, however atikramanstill remains. Anything excess of normal is atikraman. Onecomes into the realms of vitaragata (non-attachment) when hisaakramak bhaav goes away. There is a big difference betweenaakramak bhaav and atikraman bhaav. After Self-realization,you may have dislike for someone, you may even feel there isa storm brewing within you, but there is no aakramak bhaav init. These feelings of dislike will not create aakraman bhaav, butthey will cause you to do atikraman, for which you will have todo pratikraman and pratyakhyan. If you keep having suchfeelings of dislike a thousand times over, you will be doingatikraman a thousand times over, so you can only wash off yourmisdeeds by doing alochana, pratikraman and pratyakhyan athousand times over; only then will you become free from suchheavy atikraman. After Self-realization, there should not beeven a trace of dislike within us. Now we do not want tocreate new quarrels and we only have to settle the old onesthat remain.Collective pratikramanQuestioner : What is jathu pratikraman?Dadashri : Jathu pratikraman is doing pratikraman forwhat you keep remembering in general. If you constantly thinkabout someone, you have to do jathu pratikraman. Jathu meanscollective. Memory is a mirror of raag-dwesh for which youhave to do pratikraman some day, but in jathu, you have to dopratikraman every time you think of that person.If a person with whom you had created karmicentanglements has died, then cleanse those entanglements withalochana, pratikraman and pratyakhyan by remembering them,so that you become free from those tangles and cleanse yourself.If you had killed a cat, that act becomes registered on both thesouls.

Some will last for a very longtime. For that you have to do alochana, pratikraman andpratyakhyan many times over. If you have negative thoughtsabout someone, you should tell yourself, “He is a very goodman.” Saying this will have an effect on the other person. Youshould not look at his shortcomings; all you have to do is saythat he is a good man. He will definitely change if you do thisseveral times over. This knowledge is experiential knowledge.

Is saying ‘sorry’ the same thing as doingpratikraman ?Questioner : Words like ‘thank-you’ and ‘sorry’ arethey pratikraman of a kind?Dadashri : No. Thank you is like a cow shaking its headwhen it is happy.

There is a road sign showing the‘Way to Santa Cruz’, but here one keeps saying ‘Way to SantaCruz. Way to Santa Cruz’, while sitting in Dadar. In doing this,the actual process of going Santa Cruz is set aside and hebecomes intoxicated with ‘trying to go to Santa Cruz’.People have not understood pratikraman in countless pastlives. They have never stopped to think about what they aredoing and they keep talking about Lord Mahavir’s pratikraman,without understanding it. It has become a meaningless routine.Pratikraman removes the stains of atikramanDadashri : What do you do when you have tea stains onyour clothes?Questioner : I would wash it off immediately?Dadashri : You are so particular here about washing thestain right away because you know that the stain will set in, butyou do not know about the stain that is left within. Atikramanmeans creating stains and pratikraman means washing them off.Those who do not have any stains do not need any pratikraman.The Gnani Purush does not need to do pratikraman.People are quick to wash the tea stains off their clothes;they are never lax in that matter. Gnani however falls short in thatmatter, but never when it comes to the inner stains. The GnaniPurush does not have stains because He, ‘cleans’ and makesothers do the same, whereas elsewhere they (the gurus) makeothers clean but they do not do the same and hence their stainsremain. What happens when you do not know how to removea tea stain? If you wash it with milk, the milk will leave a stain,and then if you wash it with oil, the oil will make that stain evenstronger. What kind of pratikraman do people do today? Theydo dravya alochana, pratikraman and pratyakhyan as a kriyashown in the Jain scriptures. They simply recite these as apratikraman vidhi. No one does bhaav (internal, charge)alochana, pratikraman and pratyakhyan (pratikraman is donewith understanding. Pratikraman for specific faults; for hurtinganyone). Yes they do bhaav pratikraman when it comes to teastains (clothes)! True pratikraman is when it is done the momentthe stain occurs. But people do not wash their internal stainsright away, they let the stain set in and then they try to removethem. Do you think the stain is going to wait for you to wash itoff before it sets in? No it will not.When you raise your voice at someone and they feel hurt,you have to do pratikraman, because you did atikraman. Youhave to do pratikraman for any atikraman you do.Correct and precise procedure of pratikramanQuestioner : What does one do in pratikraman?Dadashri : You have to recall the pure Soul within‘Chandulal’ (the person you have wronged). The Soul which iscompletely separate from the union of the mind, body andspeech, bhaav-karma, dravya-karma, no-karma; his and allattachment related to him and say, “Dear Shuddhatma Bhagwan(Lord; the pure Soul)! I ask for forgiveness for the mistake ofraising my voice. I am making a strong resolution not to repeatthat mistake again, so give me the energy (shakti) to do so.”When you recall Dada or the Shuddhatma and admit yourmistake, it is called alochana. Pratikraman is to apologize forthat mistake and making a resolve not to repeat it ispratyakhyan. When you harm or hurt any living being, it isconsidered atikraman and for that you have to do alochana,pratikraman and pratyakhyan, immediately.This path is a very easy path. You will be able to open alllocks with the keys I give you. Never in any lifetime will youhave the opportunity to come across such a circumstance.

Your lifeAptavani-2415416Aptavani-2will improve and you will be able to go to moksha with suchpratikramans.Lord Mahavir has said, “If you are a big businessman(busy), then do pratikraman at night for all the atikraman doneduring the day.” That is called ‘raishi’ pratikraman. And doingpratikraman in the day for atikraman done during the night iscalled ‘devshi’.This is the Akram path and therefore pratikraman need tobe done after Self-realization. You have attained the knowledgeof the Self, but the old stock of past karma will cause you to doatikraman and for that you have to do pratikraman. TheShuddhatma i.e. the real Self does not have to do thepratikraman; you have to make your mind, body and speech doit. The doer-ship of ‘I am doing it’ is gone and as our real Selfform we are pure; therefore the Self does not have to do thepratikraman. If the Shuddhatma does pratikraman it will becomepoisonous. Shuddhatma, does not do pratikraman, but makesthe mind, body and speech complex do it. This path is theAkram path, in which the Self is attained first, and then thekarmic debts have to be paid off. In Akram path first we stopthe inner turmoil and then we pay off our debts, whereas in theKramic path as one pays off his debts first, one comes intoGnan and attains inner peace.* * * * *Yogeshwar Lord KrishnaQuestioner : What is swa-dharma? The Vaishnavreligion tells us to remain in swa-dharma and not to go to par-dharma.Dadashri : Our people have not understood the wordswa-dharma at all. They think swa-dharma is the Vaishnavreligion and par-dharma is all other religions such as Shaivism,Jainism etc. Lord Krishna said, “Par-dharma bhayavaha,”People understood this to mean, ‘There is danger in practicingany religion other than the Vaishnav religion.’ All the otherreligions too say that par-dharma means there is danger in otherreligions, but no one understands the true meaning of swa-dharma or par-dharma. Par-dharma means dharma of the non-self, the body complex, prakruti, and swa-dharma is the dharmaof the Self. Washing and bathing the body, making it fast etc.,are all religions of the body; it is par-dharma. There is no swa-dharma in that. The Self is your natural state (swaroop). LordKrishna had said, “The religion of the Self is swa-dharma andany other activities such as fasting or penance are activities ofthe non-self. There is nothing of the Self in them.”Swa-dharma can only be practiced when one understandsand recognizes that one’s Self within, is Krishna. A trueVaishnav is the one who recognizes the Lord Krishna within.Today there is no one who has become a true Vaishnav. Noteven according to the definition, “Vaishnav jan to tene kahiyeje piid parayii jane re - a true Vaishnav is the one who knowsthe suffering of others.”These Vaishnavs say, “We practice Lord Krishna’sAptavani-2415416Aptavani-2will improve and you will be able to go to moksha with suchpratikramans.Lord Mahavir has said, “If you are a big businessman(busy), then do pratikraman at night for all the atikraman doneduring the day.” That is called ‘raishi’ pratikraman. And doingpratikraman in the day for atikraman done during the night iscalled ‘devshi’.This is the Akram path and therefore pratikraman need tobe done after Self-realization. You have attained the knowledgeof the Self, but the old stock of past karma will cause you to doatikraman and for that you have to do pratikraman. TheShuddhatma i.e. the real Self does not have to do thepratikraman; you have to make your mind, body and speech doit. The doer-ship of ‘I am doing it’ is gone and as our real Selfform we are pure; therefore the Self does not have to do thepratikraman. If the Shuddhatma does pratikraman it will becomepoisonous.

Surely one has to worry about the business!”Just look at these ‘doers’ who are out to do things themselves!Lord Krishna has said so many things; He said, “Enjoythe circumstance that is present before you and do not worryabout what is not.” Food on your plate in front of you is acircumstance present before you. Businessmen do not enjoytheir meals; their chit is always in their business. The body wouldbe eating at the table but the chit will be at the factory. Now tellme what can even Lord Krishna do?

Five hundred years ago, the Hindu religion was on theverge of extinction. Women could not leave their homes to goto the temples or elsewhere. Acharya Vallabh established theworship of the child Krishna in individual Hindu homes, and thusmade the adjustment during a difficult time. This is how he gavesupport (pushti) to the Hindu religion. But this practice, dharmawas meant for only that difficult period in history. Vallabhacharyahad said that the religion would last about five hundred years.Today the five hundred years are ending. Now the religion of theSoul (Atmadharma) is coming to light.

He was a naishthik brahmachari.Questioner : What does naishthik brahmachari mean?Dadashri : It means the one in whom there is constantinner intent of devotion and sincerity towards celibacy(brahmacharya). His discharging karmas are that of non-celibacy but his charging karmas are of absolute, pure andcontinuous celibacy. Lord Krishna had sixteen hundred queensand yet he was a naishthik brahmachari (celibate). Let meexplain how. If a man steals but his constant inner intent is, ‘I donot want to steal,’ then he has naishthik achauriya (inner intentof non-stealing). This inner intent is the account of what is beingcharged for the life to come. A man makes a charitablecontribution but in his deep inner intent (bhaav) he holds, ‘Ishould take advantage of these people’, in this case, hisdonation is not considered a donation for the next life.Everything that one sees and experiences through the senses hasno impact and is of no value as far as the account of the nextlife (charging of new karma) is concerned. What is ofsignificance, and has a direct impact in charging new karma isonly one’s inner intent. This is happening simultaneously duringall overt and external activities.Questioner : Then why is Lord Krishna called a man ofgood conduct?Dadashri : He was a naishthik brahmachari. His conducthas been criticized by some as being sinful and indulgent. LordKrishna was a Vasudev. What is a Vasudev? It means one is anenjoyer of everything yet is worthy of moksha. Such a personis an extraordinary person.True union with the Lord withinQuestioner : What is this process where one unites withthe Lord within (brahma sambandha)?Dadashri : When one experiences bliss of the Self within,then the intense desire to know the Lord within increases andthereafter the connection with the Lord is established (brahmasambandha). When he does not forget the Lord within for evena second, that state is called brahma sambandha. Then onewill not have any worries. You will have a constant awarenessof the Self after ‘we’ give you the knowledge of the Self, andthat means that a true union with the Lord has occurred.Otherwise, the ritual of tying a kanthi (string of tiny woodenbeads offered by the guru, worn around the neck) is meant tokeep one in good conduct.

Vallabhacharya had given supportto the path of Vedanta. What kind of worldly conduct existed inthe time of Vallabhacharya? People used to do the darshan ofthe maharaj and the maharaj used to do the darshan of the pureSoul within them. Everything has changed now because of thestrangeness of the era of this current time cycle. If people dodarshan of maharaj and he does not do darshan of their pureSoul, then the maharaj himself loses out. Now who wouldunderstand this? Now this era of the current time cycle is comingto an end and so even all relative religions are going to bereestablished with the original message of their founder. ‘We’will reset these relative religions which have been ‘upset’, by‘upsetting’ them (exposing the misgivings and establishing thecorrect understanding).Connection with Lord Krishna withinQuestioner : How did Meera and Narsinh have directdarshan (sakshatkar) of Lord Krishna?Dadashri : What Meera and Narsinh saw was notKrishna. The ‘seer’ that saw, is Krishna. The one who says, “Ican see Krishna within,” is the object to be seen (drashya) andthe seer (drashta) is the real Krishna. The true darshan of ‘thisKrishna’ can only be done through the grace of a Gnani Purush.At the time of Meera and Narsinh there was no Gnani Purusharound and therefore you cannot consider their experience astrue darshan of Lord Krishna. Devotees like Narsinh, Meera,Kabir, Akha, Gnandeva, and Tookaram are still around. Noneof them have attained liberation. However, now they have takenthe knowledge of the Self from me.As long as you are a devotee, you are separate from God(the Lord within). The work is complete when the devoteebecomes one with God. No one has really understood LordKrishna at all. Some have labeled Him ‘the one with a flute’.Some called him ‘the one with the gopis’, etc. Alio, the streetvendor sells pictures depicting Lord Krishna; people buy thesepictures and worship them. This is nothing but a business! LordKrishna cannot be like that. He is not what you imagine Him tobe. Everyone worships the child Krishna; they put his small idolor picture on a little baby cradle and swing him back and forth.No one worships the Yogeshwar Krishna who had becomeestablished in Gnan; knowledge of the Self. Krishna says,“People are wrong. They fast every year on my birthday and thenext day they indulge in rich fatty foods. These are my owndevotees and yet they contradict me. They make me out to bethe one carrying a flute and call me deceitful. They say I usedto frolic with the gopis (the cowgirls). They have maligned meso much.”When a person worships and devotes himself to the idol(murta) he remains the idol, the formed non-self complex. Whenhe a person worships and devotes himself to the formless(amurta) he attains the formless Self and become liberated. Toconstantly remain as the Self, is charitra (atma charitra; realconduct). This state of absolute purity (shuddha dasha) isoneness with all (abhedta). In this state, one sees the Self in all(atma vat sarva bhuteshu). That is absolute purity aboundingeverywhere. The Gnan (Self knowledge), darshan (vision as theSelf), charitra (staying as the Self) and the bliss is the real Light(jyoti), not this physical lamp (deevo). The One who is theKnower and the Seer i.e. gnata-drashta is Krishna; not theobject that is seen.Difference between Lord Rama & Lord KrishnaQuestioner : Is it true when they say that Lord Ramawas partial Purushottam and Lord Krishna was absolutePurushottam (the highest amongst men, the absolute state ofenlightenment)?Dadashri : Actually Lord Krishna cannot be consideredabsolute Purushottam.

The true darshan of ‘thisKrishna’ can only be done through the grace of a Gnani Purush.At the time of Meera and Narsinh there was no Gnani Purusharound and therefore you cannot consider their experience astrue darshan of Lord Krishna. Devotees like Narsinh, Meera,Kabir, Akha, Gnandeva, and Tookaram are still around. Noneof them have attained liberation. However, now they have takenthe knowledge of the Self from me.As long as you are a devotee, you are separate from God(the Lord within). The work is complete when the devoteebecomes one with God. No one has really understood LordKrishna at all. Some have labeled Him ‘the one with a flute’.Some called him ‘the one with the gopis’, etc. Alio, the streetvendor sells pictures depicting Lord Krishna; people buy thesepictures and worship them. This is nothing but a business! LordKrishna cannot be like that. He is not what you imagine Him tobe. Everyone worships the child Krishna; they put his small idolor picture on a little baby cradle and swing him back and forth.No one worships the Yogeshwar Krishna who had becomeestablished in Gnan; knowledge of the Self. Krishna says,“People are wrong. They fast every year on my birthday and thenext day they indulge in rich fatty foods. These are my owndevotees and yet they contradict me. They make me out to bethe one carrying a flute and call me deceitful. They say I usedto frolic with the gopis (the cowgirls). They have maligned meso much.”When a person worships and devotes himself to the idol(murta) he remains the idol, the formed non-self complex. Whenhe a person worships and devotes himself to the formless(amurta) he attains the formless Self and become liberated. Toconstantly remain as the Self, is charitra (atma charitra; realconduct). This state of absolute purity (shuddha dasha) isoneness with all (abhedta). In this state, one sees the Self in all(atma vat sarva bhuteshu). That is absolute purity aboundingeverywhere. The Gnan (Self knowledge), darshan (vision as theSelf), charitra (staying as the Self) and the bliss is the real Light(jyoti), not this physical lamp (deevo). The One who is theKnower and the Seer i.e. gnata-drashta is Krishna; not theobject that is seen.Difference between Lord Rama & Lord KrishnaQuestioner : Is it true when they say that Lord Ramawas partial Purushottam and Lord Krishna was absolutePurushottam (the highest amongst men, the absolute state ofenlightenment)?Dadashri : Actually Lord Krishna cannot be consideredabsolute Purushottam. Only Lord Rama is the absoluteAptavani-2425426Aptavani-2Purushottam because he attained complete enlightenment andattained final liberation. Lord Rama became Parmatma (supremeSelf). Lord Krishna cannot be called Parmatma; He is consideredGod (Bhagwan; Lord). He has not attained final moksha yet. Heis going to be a Tirthankara in the next cycle of twenty-fourTirthankaras and then he will attain final moksha. Why do theycall Lord Krishna absolute Purushottam? It is just to givesignificance and importance to the one who is present. Thosewho have gone to moksha cannot do anything for us. It is onlythe One who is still present in the universe who may make aconnection for us and get our work done. Devaki, Balaram andKrishna, all three are going to be Tirthankaras of the samefamily. His nephew, Lord Neminath, became the twenty-secondTirthankara. His whole family was of dark complexion; greatmen were born in that!Mystery of Gita in just two words !Questioner : Why did Lord Krishna tell Arjun to fightthe battle of Mahabharata?Dadashri : At that moment Lord Krishna was the nimitfor these words. Arjun was overcome with worldly attachment.In spite of having the duty (dharma) of a Kshatriya (those meantto perform the role of a warrior), he was overcome withattachment (moha) for his brothers and teachers who wereposing as his enemies. To remove this delusion, Lord Krishnacautioned Arjun and said, “Remove your illusion. Come to Yourdharma. Be the Self. Do not become the doer or the non-doerof karma.” Lord Krishna knew ‘vyavasthit’ and so whatever heuttered was within the laws of vyavasthit, but people do notunderstand this and so they question why the Lord being aGnani would say, “Kill them all.” This instruction was applicablefor that moment, but it was not an instruction for the duration ofhis entire life. Seeing all his relatives around him, Arjun wasovercome with attachment and affection. Lord Krishna knewthat his attachment was temporary and that is why Lord Krishnaspoke to him as a nimit (not the owner of the words). He toldArjun, “You are a Kshatriya and your parmanus (prakruti’sconstitution) are such that they will not refrain from fighting. ThisI can see in my Gnan that your vyavasthit is thus. Therefore, donot have this false attachment (moha). In order to kill, carry outyour actions without attachment. Do not have this ego of, ‘I amkilling all these people.’Lord Krishna had attained a divine inner vision(divyachakshu) from Lord Neminath and only thereafter did Hegive instruction in the Gita.Lord Krishna is trying to say only two words in the Gita.People cannot understand those two words and that is why hehad to create the whole Gita and just to understand the Gita,people have written commentaries. Lord Krishna, himself says,“Only one out of a thousand people will understand the gross orovert (sthool) meaning of what I am saying in the Gita. Out ofthousand such people, only one can understand the subtle(sookshma) meaning of what I am saying. Out of one thousandsuch people, only one can understand the subtler (sookshmatar)meaning, out of those who understand the subtler meaning, onlyone can understand exactly the essence (sookshmatam) ofwhat I am saying.” (One in a trillion) Now out of three and a halfbillion people, who would qualify to understand what LordKrishna was saying? Only the one, who has become KrishnaHimself, can say what Lord Krishna was trying to say in the twowords. No one else can. Today, ‘we’ have come as Krishna sowhatever work you need to get done, get it done. What didLord Krishna mean? When a person dies, what is it that leaveswhen people say, “He left the body?” That, which leaves, is the‘real thing’ and whatever is left behind is the ‘packing’. Whatyou see with your physical eyes is the packing and the material(Soul or Atma) is within. There are varieties of packings. Someare in the form of a tree, some in the form of a donkey, someAptavani-2425426Aptavani-2Purushottam because he attained complete enlightenment andattained final liberation.

Someare in the form of a tree, some in the form of a donkey, someAptavani-2427428Aptavani-2in the form of a man or a woman, etc., but the material, thecontent within each is the same. The packing can be in any form;it can even be rotten but a businessman is not really concernedwith the outer packing, he is only concerned with the materialwithin. Similarly, you should do the darshan of that material (theSelf, the Lord) within the packing (body).Lord Krishna says, “The ‘material’ that is within isprecisely what I am; that verily is Krishna. Recognize Him andyou will find what you are looking for. Otherwise, even if yousing the verses of the Gita for millions of lifetimes, you will notmake any progresses.” Whatever Lord Krishna is saying isconveyed in these two words: ‘packing’ and ‘material’, butthese so called smart people try to find the meaning in the Gitaand publish books in the process. They do not know how toextract the essence of His message and then they write volumesof commentaries and criticisms in trying to extract the essence.They do this out of their own intellectually driven agendas(swachhand) in order to gain recognition and fame. But theentire inner intent of Lord Krishna is within these two words.When a young man is in college, his father writes him astrong letter, “You do not study and waste my money. All youdo is watch movies and plays.” The son shows the letter to hisfriend and says, “See what my father is like? He is an animal.He is an angry man. He is an angry, greedy and a tight fistedman.” The young man says that because he does not understandwhat his father is saying. He cannot understand his father’s innerintent. The age difference between him and his father is only 25years and yet he does not understand his father’s intention, sowho can understand Lord Krishna’s intention after fivethousand years? Who can expose Lord Krishna’s intention?Only the one who is Lord Krishna himself can do so. Who canexpose Lord Mahavir’s intent? Only Lord Mahavir himself! Andthe time difference between Lord Mahavir and now is 2500years!In the old days a son understood his father even with anage difference of twenty-five years but today one does not havethe inner ability to understand what the father is really trying toconvey. So how is anyone going to understand what LordKrishna was trying to convey? There is a lot being written aboutthe Gita but the author himself does not understand even a hair’sworth of the essence of the Gita. This is like the blind leading theblind. It is all useless. It is like that. Yet it is not wrong; it iscorrect but it is all comparable to a teacher of the first standard.Here with ‘us’ the talks you hear are comparable to the level ofPh.D. These commentaries on the Gita are like the teaching inthe first year of school. One can only get complete informationon all the scriptures from a Gnani Purush.Magnificent darshan to ArjunQuestioner : Lord Krishna had shown the universalvision (vishwadarshan) to Arjun? What is it?Dadashri : That vishwadarshan is not the same asAtmagnan (knowledge of the Self). So many are born, die andare born again. This is how everyone is caught up in the timecycle, therefore there is no one that kills or gives or spares life(creator, sustainer, destroyer). “Therefore Dear Arjun, the moha(the illusion) that attaches you to doer ship, that You are ‘doing’the killing is wrong, so let it go.” For this Lord Krishna showedhim a violent and a very frightful scene; he showed Arjun a vastpicture wherein everyone is dead. Upon beholding this, Arjunwas shaken up, but as he understood everything, he becameready to fight. Then the Lord showed Arjun the tranquil state ofthe Self. In all this vast scene (virat swaroop) that the Lord had‘seen’ Himself, is what He had shown to Arjun and that is what‘we’ call vyavasthit.It is vyavasthit even when your pocket gets picked, youwill not have any anxieties or desires when you understand this.Knowing and understanding vyavasthit will not create illusionAptavani-2427428Aptavani-2in the form of a man or a woman, etc., but the material, thecontent within each is the same.

The inspiration from within, makes everything moveforward. All these inner components of mind, intellect, chit andego, as well as all that meets the eye and the senses, everythingthat goes on the outside; are ‘machineries’ which run accordingto vyavasthit.Sudarshan ChakraQuestioner : What is the circular spinning weapondepicted on Lord Krishna’s right index finger (Sudarshanchakra)?Dadashri : It is the samyak darshan (enlightened worldview, Self-realization) that Lord Neminath bestowed upon him.Sudarshan (right darshan, ‘I am the Self’) means samyakdarshan but people depicted this in a graphic form and everyonethinks it is a weapon which cuts people.One Maharaj asked me, “I hear that you give divyachakshu(divine inner vision) within an hour. How big are they?” I toldhim, “They are as big as a cartwheel.” Now what else can I tellhim? While instructing the Gita to Arjun, Lord Krishna gave himthis divine inner vision (divyachakshu) for five minutes; this verilyis what ‘we’ give you within an hour. This is establishedpermanently in the one who receives it. Then, with this vision hesees the Self in everyone (atmavat sarva bhuteshu). LordKrishna has said, “A Gnani Purush destroys the effects ofdemerit karma (paap) of endless past lives.” Not only does theGnani destroy these karmas, but He also gives you the divineinner vision along with it; He gives you the awareness (laksha)of the Self. A Gnani Purush of the Akram Vignan Path is ‘nabhuto na bhavishyati.’ It means such a One was never around,and will never come again. Therefore, get your work done in Hisdirect presence.Vedas do not lead one beyond the three gunasIn the Gita, Lord Krishna has said, “Vedas are not outsidethe three gunas (attributes of the non-self; the prakruti). TheVedas verily illuminate the three gunas.” It was after meetingLord Neminath that Lord Krishna spoke the Gita. Prior to thatHe was a Vedanti; one who follows the Vedas. In the Gita, Hesaid, “Traigunya vishayo vedo nistraiyai gunyo Bhavarjuna.”He made this great statement. He said that in order to know theSelf, one will have to go beyond, the Vedanta. He said, “Hey,Arjun! Go beyond the holder of the three gunas (trigunatmaki.e. the prakruti) to know the Self.” What are these three gunas?They are sattva (goodness, relative awareness), rajas (passion,desires) and tamas (darkness, relative unawareness, lethargy).The Vedas support the science of the three gunas; therefore yourwork will be done only if you go beyond them. Besides, eachof these three gunas exists as duality and therefore goes beyondthe three gunas and understands the Self that is beyond alldualities. Lord Krishna has said for one to go beyond the threegunas in order to realize the Atma but people do not understandthis. What do all the four Vedas themselves say, in theirconclusion? They say, “Ne iti…Ne iti… This is not that…this isnot that…” The Self that you are looking for is not in this;therefore if you want to know the Atma, go to a Gnani.”Lord Krishna has said, “God has not created this world;it has come about naturally (swabhavik).”Nishkam karma for the true renunciant of worldLord Krishna has shown two paths to moksha: Onethrough sanyas i.e. renunciation and the other through nishkamyoga; to work without expectations of reward.Sanyas is a very high word but no one understands it.People have started to call all who wear ochre clothes; assanyasi. Sanyas means to take nyas- to place or to deposit. Itmeans to retrieve the self from the mind, body, and speech andplace it in the Self. Such a being is a sanyasi. One cannotbecome a sanyasi until a Gnani Purush gives him the knowledgeAptavani-2429430Aptavani-2(moha). The inspiration from within, makes everything moveforward. All these inner components of mind, intellect, chit andego, as well as all that meets the eye and the senses, everythingthat goes on the outside; are ‘machineries’ which run accordingto vyavasthit.Sudarshan ChakraQuestioner : What is the circular spinning weapondepicted on Lord Krishna’s right index finger (Sudarshanchakra)?Dadashri : It is the samyak darshan (enlightened worldview, Self-realization) that Lord Neminath bestowed upon him.Sudarshan (right darshan, ‘I am the Self’) means samyakdarshan but people depicted this in a graphic form and everyonethinks it is a weapon which cuts people.One Maharaj asked me, “I hear that you give divyachakshu(divine inner vision) within an hour.

One cannotbecome a sanyasi until a Gnani Purush gives him the knowledgeAptavani-2431432Aptavani-2of the Self. A man cannot be in his home if he is in the farm andhe cannot be in the farm if he is in his home; a person can onlybe in one place at a time. Similarly, a true sanyasi remains onlyin the Self.People say nishkam yoga means, “Do what you have todo, but without any expectations of any reward.” Well, not evena bug would leave its home without any expectation! No onewould do any work without some expectation of a reward!Would anyone go to a shoe store without expecting to buy apair of shoes? No one would go to the market if he knows hewill not be able to buy any vegetables today. Nevertheless wehave to say, “Do your work without expectations for a reward.”What this does is, while working, this statement will remind you,‘The Lord has said to work without expecting a reward,’ andbecause of this, the reward will be good. If people could trulywork without expecting rewards, they would make progress,but they have not understood what Lord Krishna is saying.What the Lord said was, “When you go to buy vegetables,expect to get vegetables, however, having bought them, if theyturn out bitter, then that is your reward. Therefore, do not haveexpectations for the rewards and do not do raag-dwesh. Acceptwhatever happens in the end.” Maintain composure if yourpocket gets picked. Do not lament over it. Maintain equanimitythere. If you go out to buy a sari, naturally you expect to get asari, but do not get depressed if it turns out to be a bad one.Accept the sari as it is. Do not expect anything more than that.Do not do raag-dwesh; that is what Lord Krishna is trying tosay. You can go to a shoe store but do not harbor feelings ofright or wrong, likes and dislikes. Therefore, nishkam karma isto not harbor like or dislike in the result of any effort.God has said in the Gita, “You have to study the Gita(abhyas kar).” Now people have studied it so much that abhyashas turned into adhyas; their study has become the only focusand agenda, feeding only the intellect. The Lord has said that inorder to remove the wrong impression, people have to study,but that study itself has lead to a wrong impression; the intellecthas taken over.Today, no one understands a single word of LordKrishna. Sanyast yoga means to not have the awareness of ‘Iam the doer’, in all that one does; this is the definition of a truesanyasi. There is not even a drop of sanyast in today’s so calledsanyasis. Placing the self in the Self is sanyast yoga. An absolutesanyasi means dharma sanyas. This is the last sanyas (renunciation)of ours (mahatmas of Dadashri). Here the Self remains as theSelf. Our religion is alaukik (beyond the world). In the relativereligions, the self is made to support all the penances andrenunciations through the body, supporting the ego.Lord Krishna has said that a true sanyasi, whether he hasrenounced the world, whether he is a family man or any other,is the one who has these three qualities:1. He does not have the pride of doer-ship.2. He does not have any infatuation-asakti3. He has no desires - kamna.What is this infatuation (attraction; asakti)? Attraction is aquality of the physical body. What is it like? It is like therelationship between a magnet and a pin. The body becomesattracted to whatever subatomic particles (parmanus), it is suitedto. The Soul has nothing to do with it, but people have an illusionof feeling ‘I am attracted’. For us, those who have attainedGnan, there is attraction through the physical body; the bodywhich has the qualities of attraction (asakti) and repulsion andthe Self is beyond all attractions (anasakta). The Self is neverpulled or attracted. True renunciation is defined as that in whichthe Self does not become absorbed or become one (tanmayakar)with the attraction. The false pride of doer-ship is verily theattraction (asakti).Aptavani-2431432Aptavani-2of the Self.

In the relativereligions, the self is made to support all the penances andrenunciations through the body, supporting the ego.Lord Krishna has said that a true sanyasi, whether he hasrenounced the world, whether he is a family man or any other,is the one who has these three qualities:1. He does not have the pride of doer-ship.2. He does not have any infatuation-asakti3. He has no desires - kamna.What is this infatuation (attraction; asakti)? Attraction is aquality of the physical body. What is it like? It is like therelationship between a magnet and a pin. The body becomesattracted to whatever subatomic particles (parmanus), it is suitedto. The Soul has nothing to do with it, but people have an illusionof feeling ‘I am attracted’. For us, those who have attainedGnan, there is attraction through the physical body; the bodywhich has the qualities of attraction (asakti) and repulsion andthe Self is beyond all attractions (anasakta). The Self is neverpulled or attracted. True renunciation is defined as that in whichthe Self does not become absorbed or become one (tanmayakar)with the attraction. The false pride of doer-ship is verily theattraction (asakti).Aptavani-2433434Aptavani-2After Self-realization, no effects of the mind, regardless ofthe nature of restlessness, affect You the real Self. What is thedifference between You and the Gnani? It is only that of externalproblems (upadhi). The Gnani does not have any upadhiwhereas you do.* * * * *Sthita PragnyaOne day a great pundit (a religious scholar) came to testme. He asked me, “What is a state of sthita-pragnya?” Iexplained to him, “You are in a state of sthita-agna. You arestanding on this side of the bank so make the assessmentyourself what the other bank of sthita-pragnya must be like.”I further said to him, “Do you want me to tell you what appealsto you or what offends you? You are in a state of nothing butsthita-agna; you go around in a state of intoxication from yourscholarship. The intoxication of alcohol is better than yourintoxication; at least with the former it goes down when youpour water over a drunk. Whereas you have made yourintoxication permanent; it does not go down even during sleep.It is possible for you to attain salvation, having wanderedendless lives, by doing ‘our’ darshan for only five minutes. Here,with ‘us’ (in us) it is possible to do darshan of any God youwish. Do darshan of anyone you wish.”Sthita-pragnya is not a state of experience. Sthita-pragnyabegins from the moment you begin to make a differentiationthrough words when you say, “This is the Atma and it isseparate from everything else.” The state of sthita-pragnyabegins from the moment you utter the difference till the momentyou attain the experience of the Soul (the Self). That is the stateof sthita-pragnya. The path that Lord Krishna has shown comesall the way to sthita-pragnya, however there is a lot morebeyond that. When ‘we’ give you the knowledge of the Self,you experience a state much higher than the state of sthita-pragnya.

Our pragnya (real) is the one that is established afterattaining the awareness of the Self, thereafter all matters aresettled without raag-dwesh and a state of equanimity arises.Sthita-pragnya means to recognize and know the attributes ofthe Self through the intellect that has become pure, but not theactual experience of these qualities. With the state of sthita-pragnya, one knows and recognizes the universe and itselements; that verily is called the state of shuddha samkit.However, the knowledge of the Self that ‘we’ give you, givesyou the direct experience of the Self and that is called‘parmartha samkit’, and with that state one sees, recognizesand experiences the universe and its elements.One does not become emotional in the state of sthita-pragnya, however this state does not lead one to a state ofsamadhi (uninterrupted bliss). Samadhi can only occur uponattaining the Self. When the illusion of ‘I am Chandulal’ leaves,a state of samadhi occurs.Which is the last station Lord Krishna refers to in theGita? The state of sthita-pragnya is the last station in the Gita.He says, “Attain the state of sthita-pragnya,” but people had toquestion, “What does sthita-pragnya do?” The Lord had toexplain what sthita-pragnya is. That which becomes stable inpragnya; that which pushes away the non essence (the non-self)and makes you attain the essence (the Self) is sthita-pragnya.And your state of the Shuddhatma (the Self) is much higher thanthe state of sthita-pragnya.Lord Krishna has written that if one becomes vitarag (freefrom all attachment), he will become fearless.PragnyashaktiThere are two kinds of shaktis (energies). The Soul withineveryone is the same. Whether a person is a Jain, a Vaishnav oran ordinary workingman, only two types of shaktis arise withinthem. Agnashakti (energies of ignorance) arises when onecomes across circumstances of ignorance. That is calledagnabrahma (a state of ego). From this the worldly life iscreated. This energy of ignorance will not allow one to escapethe worldly life. The energy of ignorance runs everything life afterlife. When one meets a Gnani Purush and attains the Self,pragnyashakti (the energy of pragnya) is awakened. That iscalled pragnyabrahma (Self-realized). Pragnya releases onefrom the circumstances of ignorance and leads him towards thefinal liberation. Pragnya shakti can never be awakened withoutmeeting a Gnani. People with the light of pragnya will acquire theenergies of the Self and ignorance will leave. Thereafter pragnyashakti will take care of everything.What is the nature of pragnya? Its nature is to bringresolution to the interaction of worldly life, one way or another,in any way that it can and pave the way for moksha. And whatdoes agna shakti constantly do? It does not allow you to escapethe worldly life. The Self does not have to do anything in this.Agna and pragnya are not the energies of the self; they havearisen due to scientific circumstantial evidences.

It keeps you in Gnan, as the Self and it willincrease your awareness and help You to settle your files withequanimity.Pragnya is a part of the Soul (the Self), which makes aconnection between the Soul and the external world i.e.between the Self and the non-self. The Shuddhatma is pureanyway, but what does pragnya do? It keeps You and theprocess of the worldly life separate. It keeps the real and therelative self separate. Pragnya constantly keeps the Self awayfrom the worldly life and takes one towards moksha. There areinfinite regions (pradesh) of the Soul, but all of them arecovered with a veil of ignorance. Day by day these veils becomedestroyed with the Gnan that ‘we’ have given you, and the lightof the Self will increase and You will begin to see your ownmistakes. These faults begin to leave as You ‘see’ them. Thisformed complex (putadu; the physical body) is full of faults; Youwill attain moksha when these faults go away. After acquiringGnan, Chandubhai and You become separate and thenChandubhai’s faults become apparent with pragnya. Whateverfaults You ‘see’ will be shed. In the absence of Gnan, you havedone nothing but accumulated faults even when you did not wantto. Now after Gnan, the faults begin to leave and You begin tobecome vitarag as they leave. Ultimately You have to becomeparmatmaswarup (the supreme Self), but you cannot attain thereal understanding until the Self is attained. The vitarag Lordshad attained Self-realization, and through correct understandingthey became free from faults and attained final liberation.A fraction of Kevalgnan (absolute enlightened state), iswhat we call pragnya. Each and every Atma has an ability toilluminate the entire universe. Meaning if the Soul leaves thebody in a state free of any veil of ignorance over it, it has theability to illuminate the whole universe. That is why followers ofVedantas call the Atma, omnipresent (sarvavyapi). But in whatsense is it omnipresent? The Atma’s light illuminates the entireuniverse, when it is free from the final veil. In such a state, whywould it remain in the universe? It goes straight to theSiddhkshetra; location just above the crest of the universe whereall liberated souls reside.The energy; the Self that has the potential to illuminate theentire universe is called swa samvedan shakti. When it doesilluminate the entire universe, it is called keval Gnan. Theexperience you feel during the night, after ‘we’ give you Gnan,is swa-samvedan shakti. We call it swasamvedan because of thepresence of the body; otherwise there is no vedan (theexperience).Pragnya shakti (energy) is that which will never allow youto believe what is not your, as yours; and what is not yours willnever be allowed to be yours. Pragnya shakti blossoms withsatsang. When not even an iota of the non-self is accepted to beof the Self, such a state is that of the supreme Self (parmatma).When this differentiation between the non-self and the Self isestablished in faith and belief (shraddha) but has not comeabout in the conduct (atma charitra), then that is pragnya. Theconviction of the separation is pragnya and such conduct, is theconduct of the Self (atma charitra). Conduct is that which doesnot allow the Self and the non-Self to become one.How does bondage of karma occur? It occurs throughignorance of the Self. And how does moksha occur? It occursthrough pragnya. Pragnya arises after you attain the Self andthen it takes care of the relative as well as the real. What doesagna say? It says, ‘I did it’ ‘I enjoyed it’, whereas pragnya says,‘I am not the doer and the one swearing at me is also not thedoer.’ Raag-dwesh is eradicated after pragnya arises; the Souldoes not have to do anything. This word ‘agna’ has sprung fromwithin. ‘We’ have added a new one. ‘We’ had to use the word‘agna’ (pronounced ugna) to understand pragnya.

The Lord has said that you will attain Self-realization if you follow the path of the Vedanta and you will alsoattain Self-realization if you follow the Jain path. But he told thefollowers of Vedanta to read the Jain scriptures and He told theJains to read the Vedanta scriptures.Questioner : Do the followers of different religions everunite?Dadashri : No. Can 360 degrees ever become a singledegree?No. They all remain as separate developments.Questioner : What is Jain and what is Vaishnav?Dadashri : Vaishnavs are below the border of normaland Jains, Vedanta are above the border of a normal level. If thisbrick is half-baked, it is of no use, but it is also useless if it isover-baked. Only a well burnt brick is of any use. In the sametoken, everyone will have to come within normality in theiroriginal religion as well as their worldly life.One man asked the Lord, “We practice Jain religion sowill there be moksha for us?” The Lord said, “Whether yourparmanus (subatomic particles that constitute the prakruti) arethat of Jain or Vedanta, whatever they are, you will go tomoksha only when those parmanus become exhausted.” TheJains have to get rid of their Jain parmanus and followers ofVedanta will have to get rid of their Vedanta parmanus, only thenAptavani-2443444Aptavani-2try to be over wise by using your intellect (buddhi) in the wrongmanner (swachhand). The disease of swachhand is such that itbecomes chronic. Swachhand is to be over-wise. If I want tocome to Dadar, I first have to have knowledge of Dadar andthen if I cannot find the house, I have to ask someone who isfamiliar with the area. Similarly, if you want to attain finalliberation (moksha), you have to ask someone who is familiarwith it. Bhima (Arjun’s brother - one of the characters from theMahabharata) made a metal pot as his guru and wrote ‘Omnamah Shivaya’ on it and Lord Shiva expressed within him.We are talking about Bhima, who was quick to have scorn andnegativities for most human beings. Therefore, make someoneyour guru for whom you will never develop any negativity(abhav) and proceed further. Proceed by keeping such a guruas your guide so that swachhand is prevented.Questioner : In the scriptures it is written, ‘Tu hi, tu hi(thou art, thou art)’, what do they mean by it?Dadashri : In the Kramic path this is the vehicle toprogress spiritually, ‘Thou art…thou art’. They claim ‘Thou arteverywhere; I am not anywhere at all.’ Here when one says,‘thou art…thou art’, there is a separation between the one whois saying this and the Self. One may be able to remain with theSelf through faith (shraddha) and gnan (knowledge), however itdoes not come in his conduct and experience (anubhav).We here in Akram Vignan say, “I am, I am (hu hi, hu hi).”When will you accomplish anything if you keep a separationbetween ‘you’ and ‘I’? This is like keeping a separationbetween the God and the devotee. If there is a separationbetween ‘You’ and ‘I’, when will you accomplish anything?Nevertheless, if these people of the Kramic path were to meeta Gnani Purush they would find the solution.Shaktipat and other relative spiritual practicesQuestioner : What is shaktipat?Dadashri : Say you come across a stream six feet wide.You have difficulty in removing your shoes so you just standthere. You see a few people jumping over the stream but yourmind holds you back. Then I tell you, “Chandubhai, jump. Whyare you standing around?” and you immediately jump. This is anexample of shaktipat. There is no relation between shaktipat(physical energy) and moksha. Shaktipat is on a physical level;it is subject to increase or decrease. It increases the energy inthe recipient and reduces the energy in the donor.Questioner : What do they mean when they say to placethe tongue on the palate and drink the nectar?Dadashri : That is the path of hathagrahis (those whopractice self-denial and punish the body). Those who have ahabit of punishing the body should follow that path. Why doesone need to do that? The tongue and the palate are physical(non-Self), the dripping nectar is also physical; it cannot be theSelf. It is just the fruits of your effort. When an ice-cream makerturns the handle on the ice-cream machine, he receives ice-cream as the fruit of his effort. All the sadhus and sanyasis of theworld have drops of poison constantly dripping within (raag-dwesh), even their speech is poisonous. And from the moment‘we’ give the knowledge of the Self, drops of nectar begin todrip constantly within. Elsewhere it is like falling into an enticingtrap, because one does not have the right path. The nature of theSelf is nothing but knowledge (Gnanswarup). The path ofliberation is knowledge of the Self (Gnan), vision of the Self(darshan), conduct as the Self (charitra), and internal penance(antartapa). These four constitute the path of moksha. All otherpaths are there, what is the need to stick the tongue to the palateincessantly? Why do they have to do all that? All these ritualsare a form of pacification. It is like sitting in a pond on a very hotday with only your head out of water. But without knowing theSelf, there is no solution.

You cannot write your ownmedicine without consulting a doctor first because there is fearthat you may die, and yet where there is a danger ofdestruction of countless lives to come, you make your ownspiritual medicines and take it without even consulting a Gnani.Scriptures are weapons; if you don’t know how to use them,you will die for sure.Where do the principles of Jainism and Vedanta meet?They meet at the doorstep of Atmagnan (the knowledge of theSoul).

Butwhile fasting, on the eleventh day a woman will quarrel with herhusband, “You did not bring this and you did not bring that.”How can you say she observed the agiyaras?

How did you arrive at this‘station’ of non-dualism? Where did you find a guru whoteaches you such things?”They ask me, “Dada, why do you remain in duality?” Iask them, “What do you understand by duality and non-duality?First, you have to understand these terms. The Self is neitherdwaita (dualism) nor adwaita (non-dualism). It is in the form ofdwaita-adwaita (beyond duality and non-duality).” If youbecome dwaita, then you will have confusion (vikalp) towardsadwaita and if you become adwaita, you will be confused aboutdwaita. The Self is beyond dwaitadwaita, nevertheless if youwant to talk about it in your worldly interactions, you can say,“The Self (Atma) is dwaitadwaita, it is not partial. From therelative view point it is dwaita and from the real view point it isadwaita.” When ‘Dada’ talks, he is in the relative, in the dwaita,and when He is the Self, He is adwaita. Therefore, dwaita isthere because of adwaita and vice versa. This is so because theyare relative to each other. As long as you have not realized theSelf, if you become involved only in the adwaita, then you aredoomed. Therefore, know this much and think. If you fall intodwaita, it will create duality and if you fall into adwaita that too,will give rise to duality. And if you transcend both and come intodwaitadwaita, (dualism- nondualism, the Self), then the dualitywill not arise. There are no adjectives when you go to thesiddhagati (the location of ultimate liberation); it is a state ofnirvishesh (adjective less)! How long does the state of dualism-nondualism prevail? It is there as long as there is a body.If you believe only in non-dualism, then it is being onetrack minded (ekantik) and that means it is a wrong and anunrealistic view. It is also an unrealistic and a wrong view if youbelieve only in dualism. There should be no partiality; one needsto be dwaitadwaita; it should be all encompassing (anekant).Vitarag Lords were impartial and all encompassing; theyaccepted all view-points. To be partial means to be insistent.The path to liberation belongs to those who are void ofinsistence.I asked a believer of adwaita whether he was married. Hesaid, “I am married but we do not live together.” Dadashri, “Youruined a woman’s life? What kind of a guru do you have? Didyou become adwaita after getting married? How did youbecome so?” What is a true adwaita? When your conduct doesnot hurt your wife, your children or anyone else, even in theslightest degree, then you are considered to have the characterof dwaita-adwaita. How did one end up in the ‘cave’ of adwaitaonly? You will pay a heavy price if you got into these paths ofnamarmunda (shaving of the head when one takes a vow ofascetic. i.e. paths of rituals). You will never find anyone who willtell you the truth in this manner because I do not have any self-interest. Only he who has no self-interest can tell you things asthey are; only he can tell you the absolute truth.

Only a Gnani Purushwould not start a shop because he is dwaitadwaita. As long asthe Soul has not gone to moksha, what is it like? It isdwaitadwaita.

Do not let go of his hand.”You may ask, “Who is considered a Gnani?” A Gnani issomeone who has nothing left to know in this world. If youconsider someone who does not know everything to be a Gnani,then if you ask him something, he may get confused, what canthe poor man do? He will become confused from within and willshow you the scriptures. Now what are we going to do with thescriptures? Why do you show me the scriptures? Why don’tyou speak from within? Tell us whether the one within is deador alive? If you are alive from within, why don’t you saysomething? But why do you bring scriptures into all this? Thescriptures are just signposts. They are the ‘board’ that tells youthe name of the station where you need to embark. But do weneed signboards every time? You need them once in a while andonly to know which ‘station’ you are at. The scripturesthemselves tell you, “Go to a Gnani.”In life, if you want a wrong path, if you want worldlypleasures, if you want to experience the misery of the ego, theLord says, “Read the scriptures and practice renunciation, dopenance, do the rosary beads, do whatever suits you. Take onesubject matter and you will reap its benefits. You will be rebornas a celestial, a human or in some other life form.’ Surely youwill reap some benefits if you worship any of God’s subjects?The path of liberation however, is a path free of any subjectmatters. In this path there is no renunciation, penance or anyother external subjects.Vitarags are very wise. They have given us the simplestand a straightforward path to moksha. Others have creatednothing but confusion and chaos in the path to moksha. It is sucha maze that there is no way out once you get into it. There isno such mistake in the path of vitarags because they arehave never attained the vitarag religion.Vitarags were completely different. People are not awareand have no knowledge of what the vitarags had to do on thevitarag path and today they are doing what the vitarags did notlike. What did the vitarags not like? They said, “Do not becomeone-sided. When you do penance, do not become adamantabout penance (tapogachha).” Vitarags say, “Do not getinvolved in one specific activity (gachha) in the quest forliberation”. Penance or austerities is just one corner of a home;if you clean just one corner of your house, does that mean thatwhole house is clean? Will it get clean? No it will not. The Lordhas said, “Clean all the corners of the home.” The Lord is notgoing to clean them for you. People get stuck in doing onlypenance or only renunciation or only reading scriptures.Kabir says:‘Pustak padha padha jag mooah, pandit bhaya naa koi.’‘The worldly beings have died reading scriptures life after life,and yet no one has become a true scholar (the knower).’Kabir did not see any learned person. By reading onlybooks, people become inanimate like the books. You becomethat which you worship; that is the nature of the Self. Byworshipping the vitarags, you become like them, so worshipthem so you too can attain moksha. Of all the countless pathsthere are, this narrow path of the vitarags is the only path thatwill liberate you. Once in a while, a person can go through thispath, but it is very rare indeed. Otherwise, there are alwayscountless different paths and they are paths which lead toendless wandering between and in the four life forms (human,animal, hell and celestial). People become content to takecomfort from these paths and claim, “We have attained a lot.”Follow the GnaniVitarags have said, “For liberation you do not have to doAptavani-2459460Aptavani-2anything; all you have to do is just follow the Gnani all the way.”You may ask, “But what if I have addictions and smoke behindhis back?” To that I say, “You can do that; you can also smokein front of him, but follow the Gnani. Do not let go of his hand.”You may ask, “Who is considered a Gnani?” A Gnani issomeone who has nothing left to know in this world. If youconsider someone who does not know everything to be a Gnani,then if you ask him something, he may get confused, what canthe poor man do? He will become confused from within and willshow you the scriptures. Now what are we going to do with thescriptures? Why do you show me the scriptures? Why don’tyou speak from within? Tell us whether the one within is deador alive? If you are alive from within, why don’t you saysomething? But why do you bring scriptures into all this? Thescriptures are just signposts. They are the ‘board’ that tells youthe name of the station where you need to embark. But do weneed signboards every time? You need them once in a while andonly to know which ‘station’ you are at. The scripturesthemselves tell you, “Go to a Gnani.”In life, if you want a wrong path, if you want worldlypleasures, if you want to experience the misery of the ego, theLord says, “Read the scriptures and practice renunciation, dopenance, do the rosary beads, do whatever suits you. Take onesubject matter and you will reap its benefits. You will be rebornas a celestial, a human or in some other life form.’ Surely youwill reap some benefits if you worship any of God’s subjects?The path of liberation however, is a path free of any subjectmatters. In this path there is no renunciation, penance or anyother external subjects.Vitarags are very wise. They have given us the simplestand a straightforward path to moksha. Others have creatednothing but confusion and chaos in the path to moksha. It is sucha maze that there is no way out once you get into it. There isno such mistake in the path of vitarags because they arehave never attained the vitarag religion.Vitarags were completely different. People are not awareand have no knowledge of what the vitarags had to do on thevitarag path and today they are doing what the vitarags did notlike. What did the vitarags not like? They said, “Do not becomeone-sided. When you do penance, do not become adamantabout penance (tapogachha).” Vitarags say, “Do not getinvolved in one specific activity (gachha) in the quest forliberation”. Penance or austerities is just one corner of a home;if you clean just one corner of your house, does that mean thatwhole house is clean? Will it get clean? No it will not. The Lordhas said, “Clean all the corners of the home.” The Lord is notgoing to clean them for you. People get stuck in doing onlypenance or only renunciation or only reading scriptures.Kabir says:‘Pustak padha padha jag mooah, pandit bhaya naa koi.’‘The worldly beings have died reading scriptures life after life,and yet no one has become a true scholar (the knower).’Kabir did not see any learned person. By reading onlybooks, people become inanimate like the books. You becomethat which you worship; that is the nature of the Self. Byworshipping the vitarags, you become like them, so worshipthem so you too can attain moksha.

The Self does not havedesires; really speaking, an illusion has arisen. Jain religion hasclaimed that the Self has desires. Indeed, if the Self were to havedesires, it would be considered a beggar. The Self never wishes.It is supreme; how can it have wishes? It is vitarag to begin with.Desires stem from illusion. There will be no desire when thereis no ego. The desire is of the ego; can desires ever be of theSelf? If the Self did have desires, there would be no differencebetween it and a vagabond. The Self is the Supreme Self; it isparmatma and it has no need for anything; it never had andnever will. But one (the worldly self) has met with an obstacle(antaray). If the ego were to leave, if it were to get dissolved,there would be nothing and there would be liberation. Today theJains and other religions do claim that the Self has desires. Howcan it be the Self if it has desires? If one says that the Self hasdesires, then he has not understood the eternal element of theSelf. It means that he does not even know the differencebetween gold and brass; he is referring to brass as gold. Goldhas its own physical properties and remains within its ownproperties. The Self is parmatmaswarup i.e. it is in its naturalattribute. It never leaves its supreme state. It has never left itsnatural attribute even having come into worldly entanglements.Its knowledge has been veiled, but nothing else. Its knowledgeand vision (gnan and darshan respectively) have been veiled, butthis has no deleterious effect on the Self. Suffering is for the onewho has ego. What harm can come to the Self? It is an abodeof eternal bliss. Even a mad person is happy while asleep. Heexperiences a hint of the Self within even if he sleeps soundly.He will think, ‘There is happiness within me. I have not thoughtabout any sensual pleasures nor have I enjoyed any sensualpleasures while I was asleep. Even though I was fast asleep,where did this happiness come from?” It is because allmachinery of the mind, intellect, ego and chit, within him cameto a standstill; the machinery driven by the ego came to a haltand happiness emerged the moment it stopped. That is why onefeels, ‘I had wonderful sleep. I had wonderful sleep.’A strong desire for mokshaDadashri : Do you have a desire to attain moksha or togo to some other place? Where does your desire lie?Questioner : I have no desire for anything exceptliberation.Dadashri : If you have a desire for liberation and at thesame time you see another desire, then realize that you still haveother desires that surface occasionally. It’s like having twopeople in your home, for the most part you see only one and thesame person everyday, but once in a while you see the otherperson. Do you then not realize that there is another personthere too? Would you not know that? So do you see somethingelse too within you?Questioner : I do see sometimes.Dadashri : Is there one or two?Questioner : I don’t know.Dadashri : You will have to look into that. There isnothing to stop the one who desires only moksha. No one canstop him if he has a strong desire for only moksha. The Gnaniwill go to his home. He will ask, “Will I need to go to Gnani?Would I not have to meet him?” The answer is no, because hisdesire itself will bring the Gnani to him. Gnani is an instrument.Everything will come to the one who has a strong desire formoksha and nothing else. But if there are other hidden desires,any deceitful intent (pol; spiritual slack within), then he will notattain anything.

Who dare bother theSelf?” These people are traders that deal with the pudgal so letthem. The worst they can do is take away the pudgal and herethey are taking away from the one who has no ownership overhis pudgal. The one who desires moksha will not haveownership of the pudgal and those who have the ownership, donot desire moksha.Darshan of the Formless leads to MokshaKaviraj has written:‘Murti amurta na darshan pamey jyaMandir na ghant naad vaagi gayaa chhe.’“Where the formed one attains the darshan of the formlessThen his bells of liberation have begun to toll.’Bells of moksha will toll when the one with a form(murta; human being) attains the darshan of the formless(amurta; the Self in the Gnani Purush). There has never beendarshan of the formless at any time, if there had been, then thebells for moksha would have been ringing in all the ‘temples’ (allhuman beings). Do you understand what I mean when I say,‘When a murti does darshan of amurta (the Self) salvation willbe attained?’ For human beings that murti has to be living, onlythen can they do darshan of the amurta? That murti is the GnaniPurush. When human beings get darshan of the Lord within theGnani Purush, then the temple’s bells toll. Once the Self isattained through this darshan, then the ringing is completed andthe work is done. Gnani Purush separates the non-self (the jada;matter) and the Self (chetan; sentient), and establishes a cleardistinction within which says, “This is pure and this is impure.”Even the slightest impurity is not acceptable here, in the realm ofthe Self. The slightest impurity will not work for moksha. It is notconsidered ‘gold’. The Lord has said, “Even two percentimpurity is not gold; we need absolutely pure gold. Any otherkind of gold will not work here.” We need to attain the criterialaid down by the vitarag Lords. We need pure awareness(shuddha upayog), 99% will not do; it has to be 100%.Vitarag means to be truly shrewdVitarags are not so naïve. Others may be but there is noone as astute as the vitarag. They are truly very astute. What didthe intellects of the world call them? They used to call them verynaïve. Friends of the vitarags used to say, “They (vitarags) arenaïve. They are fools.” The fools! It is you, your friends andfamilies who are fools. The vitarags are so smart that no one canmake fools out of them. They cannot be derailed from their path.They may let themselves be fooled deliberately to stay oncourse. They will take the approach of, “If I do not let myselfbe fooled, they will not let me go on my path.” So people thinkthey are naïve. They are not naïve; they are very astute andwise. There is no one smarter in this world than the one whoallows himself to be fooled deliberately. Those who did so wenton to become vitarags.

They would notlose sight of the main path they had attained. They were verywise, they would not lose track of their path under anyconditions whatsoever. This is also true for anyone in this dayand age who follows the path of the vitarag. Some day, thisbubble; the body of the Gnani Purush will burst but does thatmean this path to liberation will also end? No, as long as thereis a stipulation and an understanding that anyone who has anintense desire for liberation and nothing else and as long as thatperson allows himself to be deliberately fooled, the path tomoksha will continue. No one can stop such a person fromattaining moksha if he meets these two conditions. He can go tomoksha on his own without any help from a Gnani within twolife times!Serious warning against misuse of intellectSuch is the path of the vitarag. Today however, this pathhas been completely smothered; people have been pushed intoperforming rituals. Really no one has pushed them into rituals,only their karmas. Those who follow these paths of rituals sufferfrom their own karmas. No one else is at fault here. Peoplebecome increasingly entangled as a result of their own karmas.At the end of the day, the bull that works the oil mill press feelslike he has walked forty miles, but when the mill owner removesthe blinders covering his eyes, he realizes he is still in the samespot at the oil-mill. That is the state of the human beings of thisworld now. They have walked countless miles on their paths, butjust like the bull in the oil-mill, they remain in exactly the sameplace; they make no significant progress. It would be fine if theywere to remain in the same place, but instead they regress frombeing a two-legged human being to a four-legged animal. Thatis why ‘we’ have to say it aloud, “Listen here!

If a man were to plant a nutmeg seed, he wouldbe able to use the nutmeg that tree would bear, to put in dessertslike basundi or shrikhand, but one can only reap the fruits if hesows the seed.

So there is nothing wrong with their rituals, butall kinds of deceptive intents behind their rituals (deceptivedhyans) have arisen in the process. Dhyans that feed the mindAptavani-2467468Aptavani-2‘brain-tonics’, are very detrimental (they increase the negativeintellect). In a trade that is pure like the trade of diamonds, whathave people started to do? Instead of pure diamonds theysubstitute them with fake ones. How can anyone measure up tosuch deceit? Better than these merchants are the grocers whosell adulterated goods, at least they sell the good and the badmixed together. But here instead of having just one pure articleof trade, they have so many fake alternatives. How can we dealwith such people? We are not talking about anyone specifically.But if someone has the insight and a capacity to understand, thenyou can tell them that the Gnani Purush has said for us to becautious in such matters. It is beneficial if you exercise cautionin the right use of the intellect (buddhi), because otherwise it isnothing but hard raudradhyan. We have different varieties ofwood. Some woods are soft and some are so hard that theyeven break the planer used to smooth the wood. If the wood issoft, we can even make matchsticks. But the hard wood is likehard raudradhyan; there is simply no solution.What is sankalp and vikalp ?Whenever one says, ‘my’ or ‘mine’ it is sankalp.Whenever one says, ‘I’ (with the belief of ‘I am Chandulal’) itis vikalp. These two are false projections of the self (aropitbhaav), the non-Self. The Self has no connection with them.This is how the Lord has defined sankalp and vikalp in thelanguage of the vitarags; however the Lord also accepts theworldly definition. The worldly language also needs to exist,does it not? People will become confused if we negate theworldly language. Do you want to know the definitions in thevitarag language or the worldly language?Questioner : The vitarag language.Dadashri : This is vitarag language; according to thevitarag language when the belief of ‘I am Chandulal’ goes away,so does everything else. The vikalp of ‘I-ness’ goes away andso does ‘my-ness’ (sankalp). Whatever goes on in the mind, theworld calls it sankalp-vikalp, whereas vitarags call it adhyavasan(vacillating thoughts of the mind).Everything is different in the language of the vitarags andit is of great benefit when one understands it. Is there only onekind of a diamond merchant? A diamond merchant fromBombay will buy a diamond for one lakh Rupees and a diamondmerchant in Madras will pay one and a quarter lakh Rupees,because he sees more value in it. A diamond dealer in Paris willpay the Madras dealer two and a half lakhs because he seesmore value in it. A true merchant will buy the expensive goods;he would be willing to pay the higher price for the real goods.A fool would not pay because he does not recognize its truevalue; he will try to negotiate a lesser price; ‘sell it to me for fivehundred Rupees otherwise I am not interested!’ A true merchantwould pay its worth.A true seeker knows the priceless nature of the languageof the vitarag Lords.Destroying your mistakes is the vitarag pathThe path of vitarag means to destroy mistakes; to destroymistakes from all different aspects and to move away from theworldly language and understanding, to the language andunderstanding of the vitarag. The path of vitarag is very simple.No effort is required if one meets a Gnani Purush to attainmoksha. Otherwise, no one has been able to attain moksha andnever will, through his own efforts. If it were possible to attainmoksha through hard work, then people work very hard in theirrituals, laborers work hard in carrying heavy bricks etc., in boththe situations hard work is involved and they would haveattained moksha. It is not so, no one has ever achieved mokshathrough hard work; moksha is achieved through vitaragata (thestate of total detachment and absence of raag-dwesh).

These two are false projections of the self (aropitbhaav), the non-Self. The Self has no connection with them.This is how the Lord has defined sankalp and vikalp in thelanguage of the vitarags; however the Lord also accepts theworldly definition. The worldly language also needs to exist,does it not? People will become confused if we negate theworldly language. Do you want to know the definitions in thevitarag language or the worldly language?Questioner : The vitarag language.Dadashri : This is vitarag language; according to thevitarag language when the belief of ‘I am Chandulal’ goes away,so does everything else. The vikalp of ‘I-ness’ goes away andso does ‘my-ness’ (sankalp). Whatever goes on in the mind, theworld calls it sankalp-vikalp, whereas vitarags call it adhyavasan(vacillating thoughts of the mind).Everything is different in the language of the vitarags andit is of great benefit when one understands it. Is there only onekind of a diamond merchant? A diamond merchant fromBombay will buy a diamond for one lakh Rupees and a diamondmerchant in Madras will pay one and a quarter lakh Rupees,because he sees more value in it. A diamond dealer in Paris willpay the Madras dealer two and a half lakhs because he seesmore value in it. A true merchant will buy the expensive goods;he would be willing to pay the higher price for the real goods.A fool would not pay because he does not recognize its truevalue; he will try to negotiate a lesser price; ‘sell it to me for fivehundred Rupees otherwise I am not interested!’ A true merchantwould pay its worth.A true seeker knows the priceless nature of the languageof the vitarag Lords.Destroying your mistakes is the vitarag pathThe path of vitarag means to destroy mistakes; to destroymistakes from all different aspects and to move away from theworldly language and understanding, to the language andunderstanding of the vitarag. The path of vitarag is very simple.No effort is required if one meets a Gnani Purush to attainmoksha. Otherwise, no one has been able to attain moksha andnever will, through his own efforts. If it were possible to attainmoksha through hard work, then people work very hard in theirrituals, laborers work hard in carrying heavy bricks etc., in boththe situations hard work is involved and they would haveattained moksha. It is not so, no one has ever achieved mokshathrough hard work; moksha is achieved through vitaragata (thestate of total detachment and absence of raag-dwesh). Regardlessof the circumstances you find yourself in, if you maintainAptavani-2469470Aptavani-2vitaragata whether you are trapped in a situation of hard workor just sitting quietly, you will attain moksha. You get nowhereby sitting in solitude or by working hard all day. You attainmoksha through vitaragata and when do you attain vitaragata? Itis when your sankalp-vikalp (my-ness and I-ness) go away.Where do your sankalp-vikalp go? They go to the Gnani Purushwhen the Gnani’s grace is bestowed upon you. Once thishappens you become deserving of his blessings and when heblesses you, your sankalp-vikalp will go away. Otherwise theywill not go even over millions of lifetimes. In trying to get rid ofone vikalp, you will sow seeds for more, so four new ones willsprout!As a result of all the rituals, one has received wealth andhis brain has become more energized and bright. This hashappened because he has read the words of the vitarag Lords.Such people started doing rituals using the words of the vitarags.Through this ‘vitarag brain tonic’ their brains became very brightand they have started deceiving and tricking other people withtheir sharp brains. They have resorted to deceptive ways andthis is a misuse of sharp intellect. What is the intellect meant for?Is it for deceiving people or is it for attaining moksha?Questioner : For attaining moksha.Dadashri : Hmmm! Is the intellect for deceiving people?What if one takes advantage of a person with lesser intellect?Then he is considered a wicked beast. The Lord says He hasnever seen such wicked beast ever before. Nowhere else in theworld, only in Hindustan are such beasts to be found and thisdisease has spread to China too. However, it is mainly in India.This disease of deception is just as virulent as the disease oftuberculosis. If I deceive you several times, you will then resortto deception yourself because you will say to yourself, “I cannotget anywhere without using tricks”, and so this is how it spreads.This is a very grave and virulent disease. There is nothing like it,it is hard raudradhyan that will send one wandering into the fourlife forms.That is all you have done in your past lives and these arethe consequences of your actions. People have started misusingtheir intellect for acquiring money by deception. The Lord hassaid, “Because you keep falling down with two legs, you willnow get four (Next life as an animal)!” Does it seem appealingto have to hear such things from ‘us’? The Gnani Purush has tosay, “Those with two legs will have four legs.” I am just wavinga red flag to caution you not to proceed further in this direction.Gnani Purush has compassion for you all. Gnanis do not haveany abhorrence towards anyone, but they do have compassion.You have made so much progress that you have enough energywithin you to ask for an immortal state (amarpad) from thevitarag Lord. This corruption of the intellect and its consequencesis because the path of the vitarag Lords was obstructed andmessed up. Under such circumstances one has to stay put untilit clears, does one not? Do you like what I am saying? Or doyou find it harsh?Questioner : Dada, I like it very much.Dadashri : The one who is within me is the fullyenlightened Lord. And this body is just a ‘packing’. Pudgal(non-Self; that which forms and dissolves) cannot be God andany feeling and intents cannot be God either. God is God; Heis the knower, the seer and is in eternal bliss. All your worldlydesires can be fulfilled through Him. Your desire for liberationcan be fulfilled through Him too. You will not be allowed intomoksha if any desires remain unfulfilled. They do not let inanyone whose face looks like he just drank some castor oil!People look the way they do because of internal discord andrestlessness. And what about their deceptive intellect?

For thatwe need the one who can give us the path of liberation; we needa ‘liberator’. And such a One has to be the one who hascrossed the ocean of worldly life and can help others do thesame. If the ‘liberator’ himself is drowning, how can he take youacross safely? The bestower of moksha comes only to give youthe gift of moksha and not to take anything away from you.What can the one who has come to attain moksha himself giveyou? Are you likely to get charity from a person who seeks ithimself? Your work for attaining liberation will be accomplishedthrough the Gnani Purush who has come to give the gift ofmoksha. It comes from the bestower of moksha who is mokshaswaroop, who is verily liberated and has a stockpile of it! He isthe only one who can give you moksha.How can the whole world understand vitaragata andattain the path of vitarag? They may not attain moksha but atleast they have to attain the path of the vitarag. Travel a milebut travel the vitarag path. Whatever religion you choose,travel the vitarag miles in that religion and it does not matter ifthere is only one such mile in it. That is all the Gnani Purushis telling you.These books (Aptavanis) are like diamonds. The scripturesare like a mixture of few real diamonds and many imitation ones.If there is a true ‘diamond merchant’, a true seeker of liberation,he may be able to identify a worthy book, but there are no suchmerchants today and if there are, they are very few. The art ofdealing with diamonds has disappeared hence there are no truediamond merchants left. That profession has disappeared and sohas its art. So what do the scriptures do? They show you thepath; they say, “Go to a Gnani.” They say this because the Selfis beyond words and cannot be described.Vitarag DharmaWhat does the vitarag religion mean? It is where there isno controversy. There is no controversy or debate where thevitarag religion is concerned.

He askedme, “Where are we at fault in all this?” I told him, “Your physicalscience is above normal and so it has become poisonous. Belownormality is poison and above normality is poison too. Normalityis the real life.”The path of vitarag says that whatever is happening isreally a cause for support for the vitarag path. It gives supportto the vitarag path.Questioner : When we think of it that way, then ourthoughts and intentions for the vitarag path multiply by manyfolds.Dadashri : Raag-dwesh does not occur to ‘us’. ‘We’immediately understand what they are doing. What are theydoing in the Jain monasteries? They are supporting the vitarag!!What is a vitarag path? It is a path where restlessness isdestroyed. The result of satvikta (a guna of prakruti which isencouraged) is absence of restlessness. There should benormality to satvikta. If there is restlessness, then the practice ofsatvikta has gone beyond limits. That needs to be eradicated.No spiritual effort should lead to any kashays; it should notmake one emotional. A person whose restlessness is relativelylesser does not become emotional; he remains in motion.Compared to the total number of karmas such a person will bindover his entire lifetime, a restless person will bind significantlymore within just a quarter of an hour.

These thoughtsare useless because we do not have any control over them.Such thoughts are beneficial only if we can do something aboutthem. To be preoccupied with thoughts that are beyond ourcontrol is nothing but egoism.” Then another thought came tome, “Is this the path that India is heading towards?” I did nothave Gnan in those days.

Thisis because none of their penance or vows has proved fruitful andthat is why they have no reverence for that specific God.Questioner : Dada, this man is a strong devotee.Dadashri : For how long do you want to remain adevotee? Life after life you remain a devotee, but what if in onelife you make a mistake and despite being amongst otherdevotees you fall into the company of some bad people? Theywould drag you down spiritually and that in itself is a trap.Ask for bhakti until you meet a Gnani and when you meeta Gnani, then ask for moksha. He will bring about a permanentsolution for you. Why do worshippers think about God? Theydo so for Atmagnan; knowledge of the Self. Knowledge of theSelf is nothing but You yourself, but you are not aware of that,are you? Everywhere in the world they keep singing, “You arethat, Thou are that,” this perspective keeps the bhagat and theBhagwan i.e. the worshipper and God separate. For once sing,“I am that, I am that!” and you will be blessed. When will it endif you keep singing, “You are that?” Why do people sing, “Youare that?” In a state of ignorance one continues to wander. Godis separate as ‘You’. Nothing can be gained by singing, ‘You arethat’. Only the state of ‘I am that’ will work. In the state of‘Thou art that’, there will always be a separation between ‘You’(God) and ‘I’ (the worshipper) till the very end. Whereas thereis no separation in ‘I am that’, there is oneness in it. Onebecomes the parmatma (Supreme Self) himself.Some sing, “Tat vam Asi (That I am)”, but who knowswhat they mean by ‘That’! Nothing can be gained by singing,‘That I am’ either. What exactly is this ‘That’, that you refer to?Only the vision and experience of ‘Hu hi, Hu hi (I ameverywhere)’ is of any use.Worshippers say, “See God in everyone”, but that is allpsychological. If you have been conditioned to see God ineveryone, then you will do so. But upon slightest provocation,your anger, pride, deceit and greed will come forth. Theseworshippers have not attained even a speck of what you, themahatmas have attained. This is a tremendous Gnan! It is ascience. You can see the Self in everyone because you haveattained the Self scientifically. The worshippers sing, “You arethat” and the Gnan you have attained is, “I am that.” In the stateof ‘You are that’, there is a separation between the bhagat(devotee) and Bhagwan (God). What is gained from this stateof intellectual separation? Akha Bhagat has said:‘Jo tu jeev to karta Hari, Jo tu Shiva to vastu khari.’“If you are jiva then God is the doer, if you are Shiva (Self)then that is the true thing.”You become the Supreme Self (Parmatma) if the separationbetween jiva (embodied self) and Shiva (The Self) is destroyed.Your work can be done if your intellect stops creating divisions(when you acquire abheda buddhi).Vyavahar of the Gnani versus a devotee‘Thou art, Thou art ((Tu hi Tu hi),’ leads to worldly life.All the renowned worshippers (bhaktas) were under theinfluence of the ego, ‘I am Chandulal.’ This led to constanteasiness-uneasiness (akudata-vyakudata) within. Bliss existsonly in the realm of the Self. This bliss (nirakudata) is beyondthe relative state which fluctuates between easiness and uneasiness.When the worshippers become engrossed in their devotionalactivities (bhakti) they become filled with glee and cheer, andthey become depressed and withdrawn when misery befallsthem. Such worshippers are considered crazy and whimsical inthe eyes of the world; there is no telling when they will becomecrazy! When Narsinh Mehta’s wife was dying, he was invited tosing devotional songs by a gathering of Krishna devotees and sohe went readily. They sang bhajans and did kirtan (chanting)bhakti whole night. In the morning a man came and informedAptavani-2477478Aptavani-2even if God were present, they would hurt him and kill him. Thisis because none of their penance or vows has proved fruitful andthat is why they have no reverence for that specific God.Questioner : Dada, this man is a strong devotee.Dadashri : For how long do you want to remain adevotee? Life after life you remain a devotee, but what if in onelife you make a mistake and despite being amongst otherdevotees you fall into the company of some bad people? Theywould drag you down spiritually and that in itself is a trap.Ask for bhakti until you meet a Gnani and when you meeta Gnani, then ask for moksha. He will bring about a permanentsolution for you. Why do worshippers think about God? Theydo so for Atmagnan; knowledge of the Self. Knowledge of theSelf is nothing but You yourself, but you are not aware of that,are you? Everywhere in the world they keep singing, “You arethat, Thou are that,” this perspective keeps the bhagat and theBhagwan i.e. the worshipper and God separate. For once sing,“I am that, I am that!” and you will be blessed. When will it endif you keep singing, “You are that?” Why do people sing, “Youare that?” In a state of ignorance one continues to wander. Godis separate as ‘You’. Nothing can be gained by singing, ‘You arethat’. Only the state of ‘I am that’ will work. In the state of‘Thou art that’, there will always be a separation between ‘You’(God) and ‘I’ (the worshipper) till the very end. Whereas thereis no separation in ‘I am that’, there is oneness in it. Onebecomes the parmatma (Supreme Self) himself.Some sing, “Tat vam Asi (That I am)”, but who knowswhat they mean by ‘That’! Nothing can be gained by singing,‘That I am’ either. What exactly is this ‘That’, that you refer to?Only the vision and experience of ‘Hu hi, Hu hi (I ameverywhere)’ is of any use.Worshippers say, “See God in everyone”, but that is allpsychological. If you have been conditioned to see God ineveryone, then you will do so. But upon slightest provocation,your anger, pride, deceit and greed will come forth. Theseworshippers have not attained even a speck of what you, themahatmas have attained. This is a tremendous Gnan! It is ascience. You can see the Self in everyone because you haveattained the Self scientifically. The worshippers sing, “You arethat” and the Gnan you have attained is, “I am that.” In the stateof ‘You are that’, there is a separation between the bhagat(devotee) and Bhagwan (God).

In the morning a man came and informedAptavani-2479480Aptavani-2Narsinh Mehta that his wife had passed away and so he beganto sing,‘Bhalu thayu bhangi janjada, sookhe bhajishu Shree Gopal’ ‘Indeed it is a blessing that this worldly burden is broken.Now I can worship the Lord peacefully!’Is one not obligated to carry out the worldly responsibilities?But instead people do crazy things, whereas the Gnani Purushdoes not fall short in his worldly obligations. Even in ‘our’worldly dealings, ‘we’ play ‘our’ worldly role very precisely. Inthe performance of drama (duties; obligations) such preciseexactness of playing the role defines the Gnani. Whenever andwhatever role ‘we’ have to play, ‘we’ play that role completelyand exactly. When ‘we’ go to work, everyone says, “Herecomes the boss.” So ‘we’ act like a boss. When I go to visit mymother’s hometown, they call me a nephew and so ‘we’ playthe role of a nephew. In the train if someone asks me, “Who areyou?” I tell them I am a passenger. When ‘we’ come here tosatsang, ‘we’ play the role of a Gnani Purush. ‘We’ play the roleof a wedding guest at a wedding and that of a mourner at afuneral. These roles are played very precisely. If they fall short,then ‘we’ are not a Gnani. If a ticket collector on a train comesto check my ticket, I cannot say, “I am a Gnani Purush, I amDada Bhagwan,” can I? There I am a passenger. If I lose theticket, I have to tell the ticket master, “I had bought a ticket butI dropped it somewhere. So fine me if you have to.”Worshippers are whimsical and absent-minded (dhuni).The word dhun (repetitive chanting) is derived from the worddhyani (the meditator). The word dhyani came to be abbreviatedas dhuni. Dhuni is one-sided dhyan i.e. one-sided attention.When the attention becomes one-sided, it is said that a dhun hasbegun and one becomes a dhuni. One becomes engrossed in acircumstance that arises and keeps going round and round inthat very circumstance and hence he is considered a dhuni. Heneeds to become a dhuni in his own Self so that dhyata (themeditator), dhyeya (the focus or the goal) and dhyan (the actionthat links the two), become one.Questioner : Is being whimsical the same thing as beinga dhuni?Dadashri : It is related to a dhuni. A Dhuni does not careabout money. If a dhuni were to come to ‘us’, his work wouldbe done. People do not let dhuni people be happy in this world;they will keep goading and picking on them. Poor worshipperstake a lot of abuse. Poor Kabir took a lot of abuse from people.Kabir once felt pity for a young couple walking around in Delhi,each with a baby boy and girl in their laps. He was overcomewith pity for the state of this couple, wondering how they weresurviving and so he climbed up on a hill and began to sing loudly:‘Uncha chaddha pukariya, boomat maari bahot,Chetanhara chetajo shirpey aayi mot.’‘Climbing a hilltop, I have yelled countless number of timesBeware Oh nurturers of life, death lurks around the corner.’What are you roaming around with kids at your waistwhen there is an impending doom of death on your heads? Sothis young couple and all others stopped to see what this crazyperson was singing. Then they all beat him up. Kabir was a truedevotee and a pure man and so he took a lot of beating!One must not speak the naked truth. What should hisspeech be like? It should have the following four qualities: Itshould be beneficial to others (hiit), it should be brief and to thepoint (miit), it should be pleasant to the listener (prit) and itshould be the truth (satya). No matter how true what you sayis, what good is it if it is not pleasant to the other person? Thisis a task for only the Gnani. Only a Gnani has speech with allfour of these qualities.

He saw thatthe street was very crowded and so he began to sing:‘Manas khojat mei fira, manas ka bada sukaljako dekhi dil tharey, tako pario dukal.’ ‘In search of a man, I have roamed a lot, and seen them inplentyOf the kind that would steal my heart, there is a famine.’There are countless human beings but none that will stealand still the heart. Can you ever find such a human being just byscanning the surface of this ocean of life? Such a man is to befound five feet deep in the ocean; they are not clearly visible, sohow will you find him easily? Kabir was a true devotee and veryrarely will you find such a devotee.There was once a very generous King. One day he cameout of his palace and saw many people out there. He asked hisminister, “Why are these people here?” The minister said, “Theyare hungry. They have come here to ask for food.” The Kingresponded, “Then feed them everyday.” Slowly the word gotaround and masses of people began to come for food. Theminister got concerned, “We are trapped now. How can weafford to feed thousands of people who are coming everyday?”He thought of a plan and asked for the King’s approval. Thenhe announced “Tomorrow the king is going to test everyone’sdevotion for the King, so make sure that you all come preparedfor the test.” The next day only two devotees showed up. Whowould come for a beating? Only two, who were real devotees,came the next day.Dear lady, do you want moksha or something else?Questioner : Instead of moksha, it would be nice if I getto do bhakti.Dadashri : Do you know the God whose bhakti you aredoing at the moment? Where does he live? How tall is he? Howmany children does he have? Do you know if he performed thereligious rite on the twelfth day after his mother’s death?Questioner : Without bhakti how am I going to realizeGod?Dadashri : You have been around for countless lives. Inwhich life have you not done bhakti? For countless lives youhave done indirect (paroksha) bhakti, without knowing God.You do not achieve anything by doing that. You keep doingpilgrimages. Do you think that God is waiting for you in theseplaces of pilgrimage?The whole world is entangled in this web.

Is itconsidered bhakti when I eat?Questioner : No. Is single-minded devotion not bhakti?Dadashri : Faith is established in the words by readingscriptures. One will develop devotion for Lord Krishna if hedevelops faith in the words of Lord Krishna. He begins with anadjustment with a sentence from someone, then he developsfaith on that, and then the bhakti begins. Then if he developsfaith in someone else’s writings, he will not be able to adjust withthe former and his faith in him will become unstable. Here inDada’s satsang, the faith is established with you in the initialexperience of the Self (nischay) and such faith is conviction(pratiti) which remains with you until final liberation.Aradhana – Viradhana : Devout worship – DisrespectQuestioner : What is aradhana?Dadashri : Viradhana is to hurt or disrespect someone.This is experienced by the person within the mind. The oppositeof that is aradhana. Generally aparadha (gross hurt) is takingplace in the world. If north is aradhana, then south is viradhana.Wherever there is aradhana, there is the presence of ‘Radha’and so ‘Krishna’ is bound to be there too!Questioner : Dada is constantly on my mind, what isthat?Dadashri : That is called niddidhyasan. With that youbecome like ‘Dada’ (the Self) and all the energies of the Self areattained. This niddidhyasan will increase through listening(shravan) and through contemplation (manan).or does not beg for anything in this world.What does the worshipper get out of it? He gets to ringthe bells in the temple and eat the food offered to the Lord.They worship pictures of God. What does that do? You becomelike the one you worship. If you worship marble you willbecome like marble, if you worship a black stone, you willbecome like the black stone, if you worship a picture you willbecome like that picture and if you worship ‘Dada’, you willbecome like ‘Dada’. What is the nature of bhakti? You becomethe one you do the bhakti of. Bhakti shows the relationshipbetween God and his devotee. As long as there is God, thereis a devotee. God and the devotee are separate. What we dohere in the satsang with ‘us’ is not considered bhakti. It is calledniddidhyasan. It is higher than bhakti. During niddidhyasan youbecome one with the Self. In niddidhyasan the self becomes theSelf. Such a state can never be achieved even through bhakti ofcountless lifetimes.If you go searching for God believing this computer to beGod, then you will miss out on the real God. Worship those whoare higher than you. You cannot worship anyone without firstknowing their attributes. However, the bhakti that is going onelsewhere is bhakti of prakrutik attributes, i.e. attributes thatare temporary and exist in duality. One cannot do bhakti if thereis no compatibility and in the absence of a strong liking for it.Bhakti cannot be done without a liking for it.The multiplication of three attributes defines devotion.These three are, worship of the name (naam), establishment ofthe one to be worshipped (sthapana- living or idol) and thevisible evidences of the bhakti (dravya). Some worship anestablished image or idol. The true worship of the ‘GnaniPurush’ has four components. These are naam, sthapana,dravya and bhaav (inner intent of liberation only).

If you do viradhana even though youknow you should not do it, it is considered aparadha. Theperson doing viradhana will be freed but not the one doingaparadha. Those who have very intense ego would end up doingaparadha. Under such circumstance, you should tell your therelative-self, “You are mad. You walk around with such uselessego. Others do not know, but I know where you are and whatyou are like in certain situations. You are mad.” You have tocome up with some kind of a solution. You have to make thenecessary adjustments in order to settle the matter. Where willit end up if you only multiplied (misadjust, create kashays)?Therefore you need to ‘divide’. The addition and subtractionis dependent upon nature, whereas the multiplying and dividingis in your own hands. If you have multiplied (aggression throughkashays) by seven through your ego, then you should divide(pratikraman) by seven too, so no remainders are left.Questioner : How can an aparadha that has occurred becleansed?Dadashri : It is cleansed when tears well up in your eyesin the presence of the Gnani.Questioner : What does it depend on?Dadashri : You do not have to concern yourself with allthat. It is all dependants upon the nimit. Crying will make onefeel light. It takes away the entire load.Questioner : Why do I not pause and think beforecommitting an aparadha?Dadashri : Because it is like a very heavy waterfall whenit happens.One cannot cheat where natural law and order isinvolvedThese maharaj (priest) do their rosary. Are you stillturning the rosary after so many life times? Do you not have arosary of inner awakening within you? Here he is doing, ‘Movebead! Another one, move bead ! Another one, move bead!’(Mechanical action of addressing the bead of the rosary as itmoves on the finger). If you ask a maharaj why he is doing therosary, he will tell you, “My guru did the same thing which iswhy I am doing it.”If you have taken a vow to turn the rosary beads fortytimes everyday and if you are in a hurry one day, then ask forforgiveness from whomever you have taken the vow. Tell him,“Today, I was able to turn the rosary thirty-five times, so excuseme for not doing five turns.” That will suffice, but instead whatpeople do is that they rush in order to finish doing it forty times.You cannot cheat in trying to count the number of times you turnit. Every religion uses rosary. It is practiced even in the Muslimreligion. This practice is established to focus and still the chit inone place. Until you attain the rosary of the chit (awakened tothe Self), there is a need for the wooden rosary. After receivingGnan from ‘us”, the rosary of ‘Shuddhatma’ starts to turn andtherefore there is no need for any other rosary; then your workis done. Then whatever is in the prakruti has to be emptied. Therole in the drama has to be performed and finished.If you had to count money fast, you will not do so.

It takes away the entire load.Questioner : Why do I not pause and think beforecommitting an aparadha?Dadashri : Because it is like a very heavy waterfall whenit happens.One cannot cheat where natural law and order isinvolvedThese maharaj (priest) do their rosary. Are you stillturning the rosary after so many life times? Do you not have arosary of inner awakening within you? Here he is doing, ‘Movebead! Another one, move bead ! Another one, move bead!’(Mechanical action of addressing the bead of the rosary as itmoves on the finger). If you ask a maharaj why he is doing therosary, he will tell you, “My guru did the same thing which iswhy I am doing it.”If you have taken a vow to turn the rosary beads fortytimes everyday and if you are in a hurry one day, then ask forforgiveness from whomever you have taken the vow. Tell him,“Today, I was able to turn the rosary thirty-five times, so excuseme for not doing five turns.” That will suffice, but instead whatpeople do is that they rush in order to finish doing it forty times.You cannot cheat in trying to count the number of times you turnit. Every religion uses rosary. It is practiced even in the Muslimreligion. This practice is established to focus and still the chit inone place. Until you attain the rosary of the chit (awakened tothe Self), there is a need for the wooden rosary. After receivingGnan from ‘us”, the rosary of ‘Shuddhatma’ starts to turn andtherefore there is no need for any other rosary; then your workis done. Then whatever is in the prakruti has to be emptied. Therole in the drama has to be performed and finished.If you had to count money fast, you will not do so. Youwill count it very methodically and you will count it over andAptavani-2487488Aptavani-2over again. But when it comes to turning the rosary you areslack. That is why the Lord says, “Where I am involved, if youhave flaws on the outside, you will also have flaws on the inside.You will experience anxieties day and night.”Akram Vignan : Bhakti begins after liberationQuestioner : Why have the saints always asked forbhakti? Why did they not ask for liberation (mukti)?Dadashri : If you look at it, there is no differencebetween bhakti and liberation (mukti). Bhakti is what thesemahatmas here are doing of the Gnani Purush. It means to haveabsolute humility for the Gnani Purush and bhakti is to please theGnani and acquire his approval (rajipo). Rajipo does not meanthat you have to massage his feet or ritually worship him, but itis to maintain absolute humility towards Him. Here thesemahatmas (those who have received Self-realization) are notlooking for liberation; all they want to do now is bhakti of theGnani Purush. I have given them liberation within an hour; do younow have to ask for liberation from me (addressing a mahatma)?Questioner : No Dada.Dadashri : Once I have given you liberation, what moredo you need? Only once you have to ‘ask for Rs. 99,999.99’!Liberation has been granted to you, so what else remains now?Only bhakti! This is the ‘Akram path’ and the world has the‘Kramic path’. The Kramic path means first you have to dobhakti, and then you will achieve liberation, whereas in theAkram path, there is liberation first and then there is bhakti.Today, people go to do bhakti without liberation, so how wouldthat bhakti last? How can they do bhakti when they have athousand different kinds of worries and anxieties within? Thosewho attain liberation first, are sitting here blissfully. You have tosit blissfully just as these people here. Why are they sitting soblissfully without any desire to leave? It is because they areliberated. Did that answer your question? All your questionsshould be answered here. ‘You’ and ‘I’ (pure Self) are thesame, but to you we are separate and different. I do not see anydifference. The difference is perceived by the divisive intellect(bheda buddhi). You still have the divisive intellect; you stillhave the belief ‘I am Chandulal’ do you not? Is your divisiveintellect gone?Questioner : No, Dada.Dadashri : That is why you will continue seeing thedivision. As long as it is there, you will see the division: ‘He isdifferent and he is different’ Mine is a non-divisive intellect; ‘Iam’ your Self, ‘I am’ this man’s Self, ‘I am’ his Self. ‘I’ residein everyone so where is the reason for any conflict with anyone?God’s addressDadashri : Who runs your home?Questioner : God.Dadashri : Where does he live?

It is fine if you havenot seen him but you have to have an address. You do not evenknow the street number. Is he married or a bachelor? If he ismarried then he is bound to have an old mother; there is boundto be an elderly lady in his home. In God’s home there wouldbe no deaths. So how many relatives would there be in hishome? But that is not the way it is. This cannot be the reality ofthe world. Only a Gnani Purush knows the truth and so he cantell the truth. The world is the puzzle itself; no one has createdthis world.

If you ask people who created hair on thehead, they will tell you they do not know. If you ask the doctorsif hair will grow on a bald head, they will say it won’t becauseof the heat in the head.

You can never praise the vitarags enough. Those thathave sung their praise have not done so with the right inner intentand devotion. They would not have the misery that they do ifthey had done so. Vitarags were very wise and had greatqualities. They say, “Keep singing praise of those who, startingfrom the level of having attained enlightened vision all the way tothose who have become Tirthankaras.” One may ask, “Then, Sirwho should I sing the apkirtan (disgrace) of? Should it be ofthose who will not attain liberation?” No, do not sing apkirtanof anyone because humans do not have the capacity to do so.Why do you do apkirtan? It keeps you away from vitarags. Youdo not have capacity for it; you do not have enough energy andyou will be held liable for it. Do not bother the people who arewalking in the opposite direction from liberation, walk awayfrom them. But people make excuses and say, “What can I do?These obstinate people act in such a way that I cannot helpseeing faults in them.” You cannot do this or say this becauseyou do not have the capacity to do so.

We have to define the meaning of thosestarting from 95 to 100. Doing Dada’s niddidhyasan is bhaktiitself. Scriptures have placed emphasis on bhakti becausepeople are weak. If only Gnan were emphasized, people wouldmisuse it and they would become weak, and would be misled.So with this intention, the scriptures have placed an emphasis onbhakti. What is Gnan? Gnan is the Self and ‘I am Shuddhatma’is the ultimate bhakti. Gnani’s niddidhyasan is the ultimate bhaktiin the form of ‘I am Shuddhatma’.True surrender (samarpan bhaav) is where no element ofthe world impresses you and you leave it all aside for the Gnani.This means I am prepared to be with the Gnani Purush and takewhatever comes in front of Him. Whatever happens to the Gnanilet it happen to me. One does not let one’s boat of life go astrayfrom His boat; he keeps it joined continuously. So how can theboat capsize? Therefore one should join his boat to the boat ofthe Gnani Purush.We can say that the Gnan has remained in his nature asGnan when the Self within the body remains as the Self. This isthe highest bhakti. However, if ‘we’ openly declare this asbhakti, people will misinterpret this and take it in their ownlanguage to the level of their traditional idea of bhakti anddevotion. That is why ‘we’ are giving so much emphasis toGnan.Jagruti (awareness of the Self) is Gnan itself. A constantawareness ‘I am Shuddhatma’ is not a bhaav (inner intent), butit is laksha and without this awareness one would not be able tomaintain ‘I am Shuddhatma’. The establishment of this laksha(awareness of Shuddhatma) is an extremely great matter! It isextremely difficult. Laksha means awareness and awarenessverily is Gnan. It is not the final Gnan. The final Gnan is thenatural state of the Self (swabhav). To remain as the Self, whichverily is the Supreme Self, in the awakened awareness (Gnanjagruti) as the Self, is the highest and the final bhakti of all thebhaktis. But ‘we’ do not label this as ‘bhakti’ because everyonewould take it down to their own gross interpretation. It is worthacquiring the blessings of the Gnani Purush. All one needs is thegrace of the Gnani Purush (krupabhakti).In the Gnanis (mahatmas), the pratishthit atma or therelative self is in bhakti and Gnan is in ‘Gnan’. The Self remainsas the Self, and one makes the relative self (pratishthit atma, theawakened self here) ‘do’ the bhakti of the ‘Shuddhatma’ and‘Dada Bhagwan’. This is the highest bhakti.The Lord Himself has said, “I will ‘do’ what the Gnaniwants.” The devotees say, “The Lord is pleased with us and willfollow our wishes.” However, the Lord says, “No I submit tothe Gnani.” Devotees are considered crazy, if they are outbuying vegetables, there is no telling where they will stop to dobhajan and sing hymns. Nevertheless, there is one good attributein devotees. Their intent lies only in God and this intent will someday help them attain the real thing (the Self) when they meet aGnani Purush. Until then they will keep singing, “Thou art, Thouart (Tu hi Tu hi).’ Once they meet a Gnani Purush, they will startsinging, “I only, I only (Hu hi, Hu hi)”. As long as you and ‘I’are separate, there is maya (illusion) and when the distance anddivision between us vanishes, oneness arises (abhedta) when the‘mine-yours’ vanishes. The Lord says, “You too are God, andhold on to your Godhood. Alas! What can I do if you do nottake care of the Godhood?’ If a young man who has inheritedmillions, goes to work as a dishwasher, and does not manage hismoney what can anyone do? Only a human being can becomeGod and the supreme God, not anyone else, not even the Devasi.e. the celestial beings.What is meant by God (Bhagwan)? Is God a name or anadjective?

No, no matter where one goes, he will becomeAptavani-2495496Aptavani-2attached to something or other (mamatva). The attachment(mamata) continues and will continue to increase within. Only aGnani can break this attachment, just as it is only the doctor’sjob to give you medicine. If you ask a grocer, “I have had aheart attack, give me some medicine for it”, he will tell you togo to a doctor. People have not understood what the Lord hadsaid and so they ‘drink the medicine that was only meant forrubbing over skin.’ What kinds of results can you expect then?You have moksha very close within you; the Self verily ismoksha.This mind will show you all kind of things. All of thatsimply needs to be ‘seen’ and ‘known’. It is the nature of themind to show you things and Your nature is to ‘see’ and ‘know’.But if you become engrossed with the mind, if you get ‘married’to it, then it will harass you. Moksha means freedom from themind, body and speech. It is an independent state in which blissremains unaffected, from one’s mind as well as from the mind,body and speech of others. What is the nature of the mind, bodyand speech? As long as this ‘shop’ (the relative self; the body)exists then goods from this shop will be exchanged with goodsof others shops.The Lord has said that the kind of conduct (charitra)required to attain final moksha is not to be found anywhere inthis day and age. Conduct that takes one into the celestial worldis to be found. For liberation, one has to remain within the Agnaof the Lord, and this type of conduct only arises after attainingthe Self (atma charitra) and this leads to moksha.This era is the best for liberation through AkramVignanQuestioner : Is it true when they say there is no mokshain this era of the current time cycle?Dadashri : The Lord’s statement can never be wrong;but what did Lord Mahavir say, “No jiva will attain mokshafrom this world in the current era of this time cycle.” Peoplehave misunderstood this statement of the Lord. There are somewho have even changed this statement and claim, “There is nomoksha,” and so they have stopped even trying to walk thatpath and have pulled others down along with them. But whosays that you too have to be pulled down along with thesepeople? The Lord has said, “In this current time cycle, in thisgalaxy, you cannot get a check for Rs: 100,000 but it is possibleto get one for Rs: 99,999-99.” i.e. direct liberation is notpossible from this world but the path is still open through anotherworld. At least you get that much in the current era of this timecycle! Actually you even get change of 99 cents on top of that!?Will that change not be helpful when you go to eat breakfastsomewhere? Today they even charge you a commission of fivecents to change a rupee, do they not? In the current era ‘we’are able to write you a check for Rs. 99,999-99. Those whosay that the direct path to moksha is not open should at leastinvestigate and find out up to what point it is open. Investigateit! If a train does not go all the way to Baroda but only to theoutskirts, should you not then at least get on that train? But whatdo people do instead? They close their doors and do not leavetheir home.

The attachment(mamata) continues and will continue to increase within. Only aGnani can break this attachment, just as it is only the doctor’sjob to give you medicine. If you ask a grocer, “I have had aheart attack, give me some medicine for it”, he will tell you togo to a doctor. People have not understood what the Lord hadsaid and so they ‘drink the medicine that was only meant forrubbing over skin.’ What kinds of results can you expect then?You have moksha very close within you; the Self verily ismoksha.This mind will show you all kind of things. All of thatsimply needs to be ‘seen’ and ‘known’. It is the nature of themind to show you things and Your nature is to ‘see’ and ‘know’.But if you become engrossed with the mind, if you get ‘married’to it, then it will harass you. Moksha means freedom from themind, body and speech. It is an independent state in which blissremains unaffected, from one’s mind as well as from the mind,body and speech of others.

Those who are born in the animalkingdom have to work even less. Those who go to moksha donot have to do any work. After meeting a Gnani Purush, shouldyou even have to do any work? The Gnani Purush will himselfdo it for you. You have to make an effort if you want to cookand clean and do the worldly tasks, however you cannot attainthe Self. Only a Gnani Purush can make it happen. If, howevera so-called ‘Gnani’ makes you do anything, would you not tellhim, “How can I do it when I am incapacitated?”When you go to a doctor and if he tells you, “You haveto make your own medication and drink it” then why would yougo to him in the first place? Would you not have done ityourself? Similarly, when you come to the Gnani and you haveto do any work, then why would you come here to satsang?With the Gnani you do not have to do any penance, renounceanything or do any work. The Gnani Purush does not needanything. Why would he have a need for anything when he is theLord of the entire universe? He, who is never the owner of hisbody, even for a moment, owns the whole universe. The gurusyou see outside have some desire, either for fame andrecognition or pride, whereas the Gnani does not have anydesire whatsoever. He does not even need the garlands you putaround his neck. On the contrary, he feels its burden and attimes there are insects in the flowers. Why would he want allthat? This is all for you. If you have a need to do so (garlandthe Gnani), then do it because it will get rid of any worldlyobstacle you may have; doing so will make your burden of amountain appear like a mole hill. I am not the doer of it; I amjust a nimit. When the Gnani Purush walks into your life, it willmake everything wonderful for you; however he is merelyinstrumental in the process. The Gnani does not have any desirefor wealth, sex, pride, fame or anything else.What is moksha ?Questioner : Is moksha freedom from the cycles of birthand death?Dadashri : No. To go to moksha means ‘full stage’.Moksha means eternal bliss (parmanand). There is nothingbeyond that. It is the ultimate state. If one believes there issomething beyond that, then he does not understand moksha.Moksha means a feeling of freedom (mukta bhaav); it isfreedom from all worldly bhaavs (intents). Worldly intents hinderthe absolute bliss within. A moment of bliss of the SiddhaBhagwan i.e. those who have attained final liberation, is infinitelygreater than the collective bliss of all the celestial beings! Whyis this eternal bliss obstructed? What prevents one fromexperiencing it? Only the mistakes of one’s past life prevents thisbliss! It is these mistakes from the past that do not allow you toexperience the bliss.

Egoless Gnanilluminates the Self as well as the non-self. It has potential toilluminate the entire universe. The ego based gnan that comesthrough the intellect can only illuminate the non-self. It has a limitand it is not independent. One takes the support of, ‘I am adoctor’ or ‘I am an engineer’ because of ignorance. He makessuch claims out of ignorance and takes support from them.Everyone is looking for moksha but no one can find that pathand thus people wander about within the four life forms. TheGnani is the only one who has the all encompassing energy toswim across the ocean of ignorance and take others with Him.He is the only one who has attained the knowledge and givesothers the same.Great fervor of moksha due to sufferingOne has desired moksha for endless lives but when hemeets the bestower of moksha on a Kramic path he makes aniyanu (strong desire) for worldly things and thus he fails in hispursuit of moksha. And those who have attained Self-realizationcannot make a niyanu even if they want to, because this is theAkram path. For whom does a niyanu arise? It arises in the onewho is being tormented from within, as if there is a spikedweapon (shalya) within. How can he create a niyanu in theabsence of suffering? Suffering means there is restlessnesswithin. If this seat is uncomfortable, you will say, “I want to geta better seat.” So you create niyanu for that. When you createa niyanu, you use all your earned punyas as a payment on theniyanu. Then you will attain whatever you have bound niyanu for.The Lord has said there are three types of internaltorments (shalya): imagined or unreal suffering arising from awrong belief (mithyatva), fundamental suffering (nidaan), andsuffering from attachment and illusion (maya). One creates aniyanu based on these three. Everyone has suffering; one canfreedom, only a Gnani Purush has it. His vitaragata is freedom.‘We’ feel that ‘we’ are within each of you. If you know how todo darshan of the Gnani Purush, even then you can experiencethe freedom.Questioner : Does doing darshan mean doing it withdevotion (bhaav)?Dadashri : No, not devotion. Devotion is already therefor anyone who comes here. One should know how to do thedarshan. You should know how to do exact darshan of theGnani Purush. Such a darshan (understanding) can be donewhen there are no obstacles. One will then begin to experiencebliss of freedom from the moment he does such a darshan.Questioner : What is the ‘visa’ for moksha?Dadashri : The visa is dependant upon whether one ispartial or impartial.These (different religions) are all degrees and there aredegrees within the degrees. They are all on different paths andthere is only one path to moksha, which is difficult to find. Allother paths are ornamental paths; they have big attractions andso people run towards them as soon as they see the attraction.There are no ornaments on this path of moksha and that is whyit is difficult to find.On a hot summers day you feel a cool breeze, you can tellthere must be a block of ice close by. Similarly, here in AkramVignan, one gets an indistinct experience of the Self. Themoment one attains this experience (aspashtavedan, partialbliss of the Self), the worldly suffering ceases. Experience canexist only in one place, not two. From the moment theexperience of the Self begins, it is called swasamvedan, bliss ofthe self. This slowly increases to spashta vedan; clear and fullexperience and bliss of the Self.Knowledge of all the subject of the worlds is ego basedAptavani-2501502Aptavani-2knowledge and it is contained within the intellect (buddhi) andGnan is that which exists without the ego.

This is the Akram path andthat is why one becomes free from suffering.Those who recognize and become aware that it ispossible to be free from all bondage and that the vitarags cangive moksha and that the Gnan of the vitarag is a path tomoksha, then it is said that they have attained mithyatva darshan.People criticize others by saying, “You are mithyatvi (the onewith the wrong darshan, or one who is ignorant).’ Arey! Areyou yourself samkit (one with right vision) that you are callingothers mithyatvi? And if you are samkiti then you would notdisrespect others in this way. And even if you are mithyatvi, youwould not disrespect a mithyatvi like yourself. Disrespectingsomeone by calling him ‘mithyatvi’ is double the mithyatvi.Mithyatva darshan is praise worthy darshan. It is only after thisdarshan that one becomes aware of, ‘There is bliss in mokshaand not in the worldly life’, and then he becomes desirous ofmoksha. His desire is for only samyak darshan (right vision),however he wanders because he cannot go beyond mithyadarshan. Nonetheless such a person has a very deep desire totake the path of liberation, when all the while the pudgal; non-self complex is dragging him towards worldly life. In such a casethe separation will occur.These two cannot be separated in a Muslim. A Muslimwill say, “God will take us up.” According to them, Allah takesthem to heaven or hell. That is why ‘Allah’ is trapped and theyhave become burdensome to him.Where does the path that leads to total liberation(moksha) exist? It is in the path, which does not push aside theinteraction in worldly life (vyavahar) at all. When one pushesaside the worldly life, it hinders and causes unhappiness toothers and that is precisely where there is no moksha. The pathto moksha is where there is complete worldly life (vyavahar) andcomplete realization of the Self (nischay).Where is the path of moksha? It is where no one has anyobjection to what is being said regardless of the class or race ofpeople listening. Whether there is a low cast person, a thief, aEuropean or a Muslim, no one will have any objection to whatis being said here in this satsang. Everyone will listen. Thishappened in front of Lord Mahavir and now it is happeninghere. The Lord was absolutely free from all insistence (niragrahi).State of the Soul after mokshaQuestioner : Where does the Soul go after moksha?Dadashri : Freedom! Siddhagati; the ultimate destinationof a liberated Self! The Self goes to the Siddha Kshetra. There,every Atma is separate and in a state of knower-seer andabsolute bliss. If you raise your hand here, the Siddha Lord hasknowledge of it but He does not become one with what he sees(gneyakar). He just remains as the knower (gnanakar). Hedoes not get bound by anything. Who would come back tosuffer in a mother’s womb? Only God knows the kind ofsuffering there is in it. All suffering is experienced in ignorance.A human being can suffer pain up to a certain limit after whichhe becomes unconscious.Questioner : What happens to a person who diesremembering God?Dadashri : When one dies with alertness he comes backin the human form and when he dies in coma he goes into theanimal life form. The human life form is lost. At the time of deathone can know where the soul will be taking birth. When thebody is being taken to the funeral pyre and a good and unbiasedperson says, “He was a very noble man”, then know that he isgoing to be born as a human again. If the people say, “Let’s nottalk about him,” then know that he has lost the chance to beborn as a human again. All this can be understood right here inthis world.Aptavani-2503504Aptavani-2never become free from suffering. This is the Akram path andthat is why one becomes free from suffering.Those who recognize and become aware that it ispossible to be free from all bondage and that the vitarags cangive moksha and that the Gnan of the vitarag is a path tomoksha, then it is said that they have attained mithyatva darshan.People criticize others by saying, “You are mithyatvi (the onewith the wrong darshan, or one who is ignorant).’ Arey! Areyou yourself samkit (one with right vision) that you are callingothers mithyatvi? And if you are samkiti then you would notdisrespect others in this way. And even if you are mithyatvi, youwould not disrespect a mithyatvi like yourself. Disrespectingsomeone by calling him ‘mithyatvi’ is double the mithyatvi.Mithyatva darshan is praise worthy darshan. It is only after thisdarshan that one becomes aware of, ‘There is bliss in mokshaand not in the worldly life’, and then he becomes desirous ofmoksha. His desire is for only samyak darshan (right vision),however he wanders because he cannot go beyond mithyadarshan. Nonetheless such a person has a very deep desire totake the path of liberation, when all the while the pudgal; non-self complex is dragging him towards worldly life. In such a casethe separation will occur.These two cannot be separated in a Muslim. A Muslimwill say, “God will take us up.” According to them, Allah takesthem to heaven or hell. That is why ‘Allah’ is trapped and theyhave become burdensome to him.Where does the path that leads to total liberation(moksha) exist? It is in the path, which does not push aside theinteraction in worldly life (vyavahar) at all. When one pushesaside the worldly life, it hinders and causes unhappiness toothers and that is precisely where there is no moksha. The pathto moksha is where there is complete worldly life (vyavahar) andcomplete realization of the Self (nischay).Where is the path of moksha? It is where no one has anyobjection to what is being said regardless of the class or race ofpeople listening. Whether there is a low cast person, a thief, aEuropean or a Muslim, no one will have any objection to whatis being said here in this satsang. Everyone will listen. Thishappened in front of Lord Mahavir and now it is happeninghere. The Lord was absolutely free from all insistence (niragrahi).State of the Soul after mokshaQuestioner : Where does the Soul go after moksha?Dadashri : Freedom! Siddhagati; the ultimate destinationof a liberated Self! The Self goes to the Siddha Kshetra. There,every Atma is separate and in a state of knower-seer andabsolute bliss. If you raise your hand here, the Siddha Lord hasknowledge of it but He does not become one with what he sees(gneyakar). He just remains as the knower (gnanakar). Hedoes not get bound by anything. Who would come back tosuffer in a mother’s womb? Only God knows the kind ofsuffering there is in it. All suffering is experienced in ignorance.A human being can suffer pain up to a certain limit after whichhe becomes unconscious.Questioner : What happens to a person who diesremembering God?Dadashri : When one dies with alertness he comes backin the human form and when he dies in coma he goes into theanimal life form. The human life form is lost. At the time of deathone can know where the soul will be taking birth. When thebody is being taken to the funeral pyre and a good and unbiasedperson says, “He was a very noble man”, then know that he isgoing to be born as a human again. If the people say, “Let’s nottalk about him,” then know that he has lost the chance to beborn as a human again. All this can be understood right here inthis world.Aptavani-2505506Aptavani-2Questioner : What happens when life returns in the bodyof a ‘dead’ person?Dadashri : No. Once the soul leaves that body, it doesnot return into that body. Sometimes when the soul retracts allthe way to the brahmarandhra (aperture at the crown of thehead through which it departs) one’s breathing and pulse stopsand when the soul descends through the palate, the respirationbegins again. It may appear that the body has come alive again.Questioner : Can there be no moksha from this timeera?Dadashri : No. Moksha was possible 2500 years agofrom this world. Why is there no moksha from the current timecycle? One has brought so many karmas that despite all thevehicles such as bicycles, cars, planes, train etc. at his disposal,he still cannot get around to get the work completed fordispensing with the effects of karma. One has brought complexkarmas and that is why moksha does not occur in this era of thistime cycle. There has never been an era of a time cycle in whichhumans have bound karmas such as they have done in this eraand these karmas are now coming into effect. Where have mostof these people come from? Most of them have come here ashumans with a return ticket to the animal kingdom. Say, with amerit of 32 points one becomes a donkey and with 33 pointsone becomes a human. One point was used up to attain thehuman body. Therefore, externally although one looks like ahuman, his attributes within are that of a donkey.The path to moksha is very narrow and a human beinggoes through great difficulties to attain moksha. Still, as per rule,every moment, a total of 108 beings go to moksha at a time,which for the whole universe is a negligible number. From theBharat Kshetra only three or four go to moksha, however in thisera of this current time cycle, that path is currently closed. It willremain closed for another four such Aras (eras).Gnani leads one to mokshaDadashri : Do you want to attain final moksha?Questioner : I do think about moksha, but I cannot findthe path.Dadashri : The Gnani Purush is now here and presentwith you so you will attain the path, otherwise many people thinkabout it but are not able to find the path or they get on to thewrong path. Once in a while, on an extremely rare occasion,there will be a Gnani Purush around. You can attain Gnan andexperience the Self from Him. Some will say, “Moksha willhappen after the body has left.” Then one should say, “No, Ihave no interest in such an ‘on credit moksha’. I want cashmoksha, here and now.” Moksha should be experienced here,instantly, while in this body. This is possible through AkramGnan.The Lord has said, “Do not get into doing wrong things(ashubha) if you do not find a path to moksha, and keep yourself occupied in good actions (shubha). Once you find the pathof moksha, then good or bad actions are immaterial.” TheLord’s path is a pure path in which there is no such thing asgood or bad, paap or punya. Paap and punya are bothbondage. Remain in good company and positive activities,because if you fail to find the path to moksha and happen to fallinto bad company and negative activities, you will not be able totolerate the consequences of your actions. You are born in agood family as an Indian; therefore continue doing good bytaking care of ascetics and monks etc., You may also go totemples, do pratikraman, samayik, fasting etc. The good andbeneficial (shubha) is the path of rituals (kriya) and its fruit ispunya. Fruit of bad and negative actions (ashubha) is paap. Withpunya it is possible to, some day meet a Gnani Purush, who hasthe power to help you. He can give you instant moksha becausehe is completely in a state of non-doer-ship.Aptavani-2505506Aptavani-2Questioner : What happens when life returns in the bodyof a ‘dead’ person?Dadashri : No. Once the soul leaves that body, it doesnot return into that body.

With goodactions, one binds punya, which rewards one with cars, homesand all the other worldly pleasures. If one wants liberation, thenone has to follow the Lord’s instruction. Moksha is attainedthrough knowledge (Gnankriyabhyam moksha). Thesepratikraman, samayik etc., are rituals of ignorance (agnankriya). Moksha cannot be attained through these externalactivities. Moksha is attained through the actions of Gnan,through gnan-kriya. Gnan-kriya is to remain as a knower-seerand that itself is moksha. To know that which is to be known(gneya) is Gnan kriya and to understand the gneya is darshankriya.What causes bondage ?How have you come into bondage? Is it through actions?Is it because of a woman? Do you not have to investigate this?It is only upon investigation that you will be able to find a wayto become free. You are bound only because of your ignoranceof the Self and so how can you become free by performingexternal rituals? Can your wife free you? If your wife frees you,can you be freed by your home? And would you be freed bydestroying attachment to worldly things? ‘The one boundthrough ignorance of the Self can only be freed through Gnan,the knowledge of the Self.’ As long as, ‘my mind’ exists you arethe owner of the mind (parigrahi) and when you become theknower and seer of the mind then you are not the owner of themind (aparigrahi). ‘We’ are aparigrahi in the ocean of parigraha.Are you bound through attachment and abhorrence (raagand dwesh)? No. You are only bound through ignorance of theSelf (agnan). That ignorance is the root cause. The Vedantasays, “Get rid of mud, vikshep and agnan and the Jains say getrid of, raag, dwesh and agnan.” Ignorance is common to bothand it is the root cause. Raag, dwesh, mud and vikshep are thesecondary causes. When you get rid of the root cause, the restof the causes will fall away automatically. When the root causeis destroyed, when ignorance leaves, the seeds for the next lifewill cease to be sown. As long as there is ignorance, there willbe bondage. It is not a problem if one life is wasted but theproblem is that it creates bondage for a hundred more lives.Who likes bondage? This path of evolution (samsaranmarg) is like a prison. From the beginning till the end, it is likea prison and when a person becomes aware, ‘I am free’, thenhe is freed from that prison. A person can become free when theillusion (mithya darshan) goes away and he attains enlightenment(samyak darshan). Only a Gnani Purush can make one have theawareness, ‘I am free’. The Gnani Purush never becomes onewith his body.All these instruments have bound you; electricity, elevatorsetc., all the instruments of comfort that were created have nowimprisoned you. You have become dependent on them. Eachperson should have his circumstances and instrument such thatthey promote his independence. A human being should notbecome a slave to his comforts. These instruments which havemade one become so dependant on them, will decrease andthere is a need for that.If people who desire freedom do not find the right path,then the very instruments that were meant to give them freedomwill become binding. Instruments people seek out for freedomand moksha end up binding them because they are not the rightinstruments (sat sadhan). A right instrument is the one who isestablished in sat (the eternal), and such a person is the GnaniPurush. All other instruments (sadhans) will continue artadhyanand raudradhyan, and that is bondage.Even the animals do not like this bondage.

As itcontinued to fight the men, a crowd of about five hundredpeople gathered around, as if bliss of freedom was beingdistributed! There is tremendous suffering in bondage. The factthat we are still here on this earth is a direct proof that we donot have the knowledge of the Self. Had we realized the Self,would we not already be in moksha?It is only in the human form that one may attain moksha.From this human form he can go to any one of the four lifeforms, and moksha too can be attained only from a human birth.A real religion is that which gives you moksha; it gives youliberation. The rest are not real religions.The Lord has said, “In this era of the current time cycle,moksha is unattainable, but the path to moksha is not; that pathis open.” When people were told that liberation is not attainable,they drifted towards the wrong paths. Of what use is a reign ofthe Lord, which is to prevail twenty one thousand years if thepath to moksha were closed? People did not understand this.Here, people can attain causal-moksha (karan moksha; you donot bind causes for the next life), freedom from creating newcauses. There is the final moksha called karya moksha. It is aneffect of causal moksha. It is not possible to attain this here. Onecan reach all the way up to 99,999 but he cannot attain thecomplete 100,000. There are two kinds of moksha: karya-moksha and karan-moksha. In this era there is karan-mokshabut karya-moksha is closed. After acquiring karan-moksha, onehas to go through one more birth. I give you karan-mokshawithin one hour! Currently, a phenomenal path to moksha is athand. ‘We’ are the ornamental decoration of this reign of theLord.All religions merge as one at the door of samkit; a stateof right vision. Then comes the gigantic gate to moksha. Samkitis attained only when all divisions due to differences of opinionscease. The Lord has said samkit will not occur because ofdivisions. The ascetics have conquered their propensity towardssensual-pleasures (vishay), however these pleasures are not theculprit and are independent. For endless lives, the attachmentand insistence (matagraha) they have carried towards theirown viewpoint, which is the reason for their wanderings life afterlife, and this is still very much alive even today. They havebecome opinionated; they live in their opinions. They areconquering that which does not need to be conquered and theydo not conquer that which does. They have all conquered theirpropensity for worldly pleasures but they have not conqueredtheir attachment to their viewpoints. They have become rigid intheir viewpoint to the point of obstinacy. Obstinacy to aviewpoint supports paap karma in the worldly life. Obstinacy toa viewpoint is always present where the Gnani Purush and hismahatmas are not to be found and where there is obstinacy toviewpoints, the Self can never be found, even if you look for it.The Self itself has been covered up by obstinacy. Obstinacy toany viewpoint will not allow one to be free. The Lord has notregarded sense-pleasures as attachment (moha) but he doesconsider unrelenting adherence to viewpoint as attachment.Harmony in the path of the vitaragThere are no oppositions on the path of the vitarags.Questioner : Why do some people object to celebratingMahavir Jayanti?Dadashri : Gnanis would not object to anything; theywould not stop a moving train. Do you think all these people areGnanis? They are blinded by their opinions. They are obstinateand hang on to their opinions to feed their egos. This is nothingbut false obstinacy to viewpoints. That is why they make amountain out of a molehill. Let me give you a definition and adescription of the kind of Acharyas that had walked on thevitarag path.

These Acharyas were ready to listen to anyone andAptavani-2511512Aptavani-2whatever they had to say. If anyone came to them wanting totaunt them or simply talk to them, they would speak very calmlyand say, “Yes, go ahead and tell me.”You may find my talks harsh but if you want to go tomoksha, I will have to be very harsh and give you a heavy doseof talking to. But if you want to live a worldly life and do notwant to go to moksha, then I will garland you with flowers.Therefore, you must decide yourself what you want and choseaccordingly.It is your own obstinacy and nothing else that hinders yourmoksha. Vishays; indulgence in sensual pleasures do not hinderyou. Therefore, wise up and get smart. There is no need tobecome a sadhu; a hermit and denounce the worldly life. Yousimply need to shape up. The path to moksha is so narrow thatyou will not be able go through it if you do not walk straight. Sothere, you will have to be simple and straightforward. You willhave to listen to strong words from ‘us’ if you want to go tomoksha. A ‘disease’ from countless past lives has filled up fromyour belly up into your throat. Therefore, I will have to operateand remove it all using special ‘forceps’. Therefore, speak upbefore I start, because it will be impossible to stop the operationonce I start. So, what do you want, moksha or worldlyopulence? I am ready to give whatever you want.Questioner : I just want moksha.Dadashri : Then you will have to understand and absorbmy words. Let me tell you what the ascetics who follow thevitarag path are like. They will remove differences of opinion ifthere are any. All, the sanghpati (head of a company), thesadhus, the sanyasi, Jains of all sects, etc., should all get togetherand discuss things and think things through. Seat the older sadhuon a comfortable seat and the young ones can sit on the floor.Should you not do at least this much? Everyone has to sit anddiscuss together. What is the vitarag dharma? If a great sagecannot answer questions of new young disciples, then he is nota great sage; he is not a sage in fact, he is nothing. No matterwhat the other person is saying, even if he is lying, hear him outonce and then discuss things and think about it. This way at leasthe will take something with him. Therefore, the Lord has said,do not speak with ego based insistence and obstinacy. Discussthings and think about where you are making a mistake. You area sadhu of the current cycle of dushamkaal (bad times) sotherefore, do not sit alone; have a sanghpati and the sangh(organization of people) with you, because the Lord has saidthat a sangh is the twenty-fifth Tirthankara. A committee of thecompany will judge what is right and what is wrong. Thesanghpati will tell you something is correct because there is aSelf within him. On the other hand, if something is not right hecan recognize that too. What harm is there in all of you sittingtogether?There is not even a little bit of insistence in the vitaragpath. These people have become excessively obstinate andinsistent. The sadhus, who cannot sit together, discuss and thinkabout what is right and wrong, are not true sadhus of LordMahavir. Lord Mahavir’s disciple would sit down to discuss andthink with someone who has read the forty-five Agams but alsowith the one who has read only two. Further, no matter howmany mistakes a person makes, such a sadhu would not harborany kashays. A worthy sadhu does not quarrel and sits withothers to discuss things in an attempt to seek the truth.If they ask me, “Patel, would you come and explain to usso that we may learn the truth?” ‘We’ would go to them and tellthem precisely what Lord Mahavir is trying to say. ‘We’ wouldonly do that if they are willing to sit quietly and listen withouttheir self conceited ego of, ‘I am Acharya’ or ‘I am superior.’The true path of Lord Mahavir is where there is no feeling ofdivision. Here even a handful of people cannot live together;they quarrel and fight amongst themselves. We know that youAptavani-2511512Aptavani-2whatever they had to say. If anyone came to them wanting totaunt them or simply talk to them, they would speak very calmlyand say, “Yes, go ahead and tell me.”You may find my talks harsh but if you want to go tomoksha, I will have to be very harsh and give you a heavy doseof talking to.

Seat the older sadhuon a comfortable seat and the young ones can sit on the floor.Should you not do at least this much? Everyone has to sit anddiscuss together. What is the vitarag dharma? If a great sagecannot answer questions of new young disciples, then he is nota great sage; he is not a sage in fact, he is nothing. No matterwhat the other person is saying, even if he is lying, hear him outonce and then discuss things and think about it. This way at leasthe will take something with him. Therefore, the Lord has said,do not speak with ego based insistence and obstinacy. Discussthings and think about where you are making a mistake. You area sadhu of the current cycle of dushamkaal (bad times) sotherefore, do not sit alone; have a sanghpati and the sangh(organization of people) with you, because the Lord has saidthat a sangh is the twenty-fifth Tirthankara. A committee of thecompany will judge what is right and what is wrong. Thesanghpati will tell you something is correct because there is aSelf within him. On the other hand, if something is not right hecan recognize that too. What harm is there in all of you sittingtogether?There is not even a little bit of insistence in the vitaragpath. These people have become excessively obstinate andinsistent. The sadhus, who cannot sit together, discuss and thinkabout what is right and wrong, are not true sadhus of LordMahavir. Lord Mahavir’s disciple would sit down to discuss andthink with someone who has read the forty-five Agams but alsowith the one who has read only two. Further, no matter howmany mistakes a person makes, such a sadhu would not harborany kashays. A worthy sadhu does not quarrel and sits withothers to discuss things in an attempt to seek the truth.If they ask me, “Patel, would you come and explain to usso that we may learn the truth?” ‘We’ would go to them and tellthem precisely what Lord Mahavir is trying to say. ‘We’ wouldonly do that if they are willing to sit quietly and listen withouttheir self conceited ego of, ‘I am Acharya’ or ‘I am superior.’The true path of Lord Mahavir is where there is no feeling ofdivision. Here even a handful of people cannot live together;they quarrel and fight amongst themselves. We know that youAptavani-2513514Aptavani-2quarrel outside but do you have to do it even amongstyourselves?Intoxication of ego blocks moksha‘We’ had gone to Ahmedabad where ‘we’ met oneAcharya Maharaj. It was during the time of Paryushan, sothousands of people were coming to greet and bow to him. Iwas introduced to him, by someone who said, “This is a GnaniPurush.” He immediately did my darshan and got up from hishigh seat and then sat down on the floor. ‘We’ told him, “Thisgesture will take you a long way.” Such wonderful humility cantake one a long way, so he said, “I sat down because I felt itfrom within.” Then ‘we’ asked him, “Do you read scriptures?”He said he has read many scriptures and so ‘we’ asked him,“You have read a lot of scriptures but did you read them as perLord’s instructions or otherwise?” The Lord has said, “Do notread the scriptures that increase your intoxication of ‘I knowsomething’ (keyf) and if it reduces your intoxication, then readthem.” Throw away those books if they increase intoxication. Isit an attribute of the books to increase intoxication? No,intoxication is an attribute of the seed within you. Does a treewith thorns have to design its thorns? No, it is an inherentattribute of the tree that it will have thorns on every branch. ThenI asked the Acharya Maharaj, “How will you reduce thatintoxication?” he replied, “We perform our rituals,” I told him,“Any ritual that increases intoxication, is a ritual of ignorance, itis not a ritual prescribed by the Lord. The rituals He prescribedreduce intoxication, not increase it.” One can never accomplishanything by doing all these rituals. He remains where he is. Hemerely reaps what he sows.The path of the vitarags is simple, easy and natural butthese people have made it difficult through insistence on selfpunishment (kasht sadhya). In the current paths of the vitaragdharma, if there were any truth in them, the world would havebecome enamored. Instead, what we see is if a person isinvolved in renouncing, he keeps cleaning the corner ofrenunciation and those that practice penance keep cleaning onlythe corner of penance and nothing else. Moksha is only attainedwhen one cleans all the corners.Moksha is where there is no obstinacy or insistence Kaviraj sings:‘Kyaya na hojo mamat lagare’‘Let me not be attached to anything anywhere.’In how many places does insistence (mamat) prevail? Inhow many places or incidents can you be insistent? If someoneis taking away this cup from you, do you not have to insist thathe leaves it? You would tell the man, “Brother, you are takingaway this cup but it is mine, it has my name on it.” He wouldread the name and realize it and would give it back to you. Itis good if he gives it back to you, but if he refuses to give it backto you even after reading your name, then you should notbecome insistent. You can say it as you would say in a drama(a play), “Brother, my name is on the cup!” and then if he givesit back to you, it is fine, otherwise let go. Do not be insistentthere. Vitarags are not such that they will remain silent ifsomeone is taking something away. Vitarag is the one whospeaks dramatically (without inner attachment). If someone iskidnapping one’s daughter, he has to tell him, “She is mydaughter. I have to get her married in a good family.” Whilesaying all that if he remains completely detached then he is avitarag. But do they not say, “This person is being stubborn andinsistent” (mamatey chadhya)? There is no insistency in thevitarag path as there is in all the other paths. If ‘we’ saydramatically, “It is dark outside” and you say, “No, it is light outside” ‘we’ would again tell you, “Brother, look again. It is stilldark outside.” ‘We’ would make a request and if you still do notbelieve ‘us’, ‘we’ would let go. Indeed if the real world wereAptavani-2513514Aptavani-2quarrel outside but do you have to do it even amongstyourselves?Intoxication of ego blocks moksha‘We’ had gone to Ahmedabad where ‘we’ met oneAcharya Maharaj.

There is no nischaydharma (Self-knowledge) outside; it is to be found only here (where the Lordis). What is vyavahardharma? It is public opinion and consentwith democracy. Anything against public opinion is insistency(mamat). Here (the current misguided Jain sect behavior)everyone will say, “This is a narrow-minded religion.” If onemaharaj says, “Today is the eight day of lunar fortnight(athham),” another maharaj will say, “It is the seventh day(satam).” Both should be thrown out as this is a conflict arisingfrom insistence.

There are two kinds ofpearls: real and cultured (imitation) ones. Today there arecultured pearls too, are there not? Which arose first?Questioner : The real pearl!Dadashri : Therefore, because there were real pearlsfirst, that the cultured ones came about. Imitation is bornbecause of the existence of the real. Similarly, real diksha camefirst, and due to its presence, we now have ‘cultured’ diksha!This is the Akram path and therefore one is not to negate orscorn anyone. One cannot reject and scorn his wife or childrenby renouncing them. Here in the Akram path, all conflicts andclash with wife and children will cease.The Lord has not used the word ‘diksha’ incorrectly butone has to know the real meaning of diksha. During the time ofthe Lord, when they gave diksha, the seeker used the followingproclamation:‘Aego mei shashao appa, naanah dunshaan sanjuo.’‘I am an eternal Soul with the attributes of knowledge andvision.’‘Shesha mein bhaheera bhaava, savee sanjog lakhana.’‘The rest are all external intents, all attributes of thesecircumstances.’‘Sanjog moola jeevenah patta dookham parampara.’‘At the root of all life, lies infinite suffering life after life.’‘Tammha sanjog sambandham, savvam tiviheyn vosariyami.’‘All these circumstances and their relations, I surrender untoYou.’The words have remained the same, but the diksha hasbecome like cultured pearls.One takes the diksha and an hour later he gets angry.Why do you get angry after having uttered, ‘I surrender my allto you (savvam tiviheyn vosariyami)?’ So, these are allcultured pearls.Such cultured diksha causes bondage, not liberation.When ‘we’ give you diksha (the Self), it completely cures allworldly diseases. ‘We’ give you the Self directly in the palm ofyour hands; ‘we’ give you diksha and make you dikshit- aGnani. People understand diksha in their own language, but thatis not diksha. However, people will not believe you if you tellthem this because whatever the language they use, theirmeanings are based on that particular language. That is theprevalent language.

The betel nut you buy nowadays,not the whole ones but the ones cut into small pieces are coatedwith flavoring and sugar. Well they soak the good betel nuts andthe rotten ones together. People have no sense whether theywant to eat the betel nut or some flavoring. If you wantsweetness, eat sweets. One eats the betel nut for its originaltaste. But they would not let you have the real thing. Foolishpeople get to eat adulterated things and smart people get thegood things. That is why ‘we’ have said that you should bethankful to the fools; because of them you get the real thing.Why do I call them fools? It is because they pay for adulteratedgoods.Subtle talks of the vitaragsToday neither diksha nor mahavrats exist. Even anuvratsare non-existent. The real have been replaced by cultured ones.What is a vow (vrat)? A vow is that which becomes natural inone’s conduct (varte aene vrat kahevay).

People do not understand them and end upcovering their nose and mouths with a muhpati (Jain tradition ofcovering the mouth and nose with a cloth to prevent himsa(violence) to small flying insects)! It is acceptable if this customis a result of advanced spiritual state which arises in theprescribed method. This covering of mouth is for the spiritualseeker in the final stages prior to liberation. He can keep a pieceof cloth with him in order to cover his mouth if he goes someplace where there are many insects. The cloth is not for thepurpose of saving the insects because in reality no one livingentity can save the life of another living entity. It is for thepurpose of preventing insects from entering his body through thenose or the mouth as that would harm his prakruti (bodycomplex). That is the purpose of a muhpati. This muhpatirepresents the final spiritual cause in the Kramic path. Alongwith this, there are many other causes. For example, causes for‘keval Gnan’ that should also be supported and adopted. Butwhat use is it to give priority to nurturing a cause, at level ofkindergarten when in fact it is to be adopted and supported atthe Ph.D. level?One cannot afford to be careless even for a moment.

If both the teacher and the studentsare renouncing or turning the beads on a rosary, then can we notconclude that they are in a ‘standard’ i.e. they are both in theprocess of studying? If you ask them, “Sir, have you finishedstudying?” they will say, “We have finished studying but we stillhave to do our rosary.” No! If you want to attain moksha, thenrealize that moksha and the wooden rosary beads are foes. Youhave to dwell (ramanata) in the realm of the Self for moksha.These people are dwelling in the wooden beads and thereforethey will not attain moksha. This is just a type of a business theyhave started. ‘We’ have to make this statement in order to alertand caution them.There should not be any business in religion but religionshould definitely be present in all business. Wherever there aretransactions of money in any religion, understand that it is not atrue religion.A person can still attain moksha if he asks for guidancebut he does not do this either. He guides himself according to hisown misguided intellect (dahapan) only. That is why peoplehave been advised to have a guru, but what can one do if thegurus themselves are worthless. What can anyone do when theguru himself is ‘market material’ (commercialized, involved inmoney transactions for his own gain)? It is good that people donot sign long term contracts with such ‘gurus’, otherwise theywill demand, “Why are you leaving after two years when wehave a contract for five years?” The vitarag path is not like this.How can one be a guru without the gurukilli –master key ?It is difficult to find a real guru in this world. A mutual self-serving relationship between a guru and his disciple will alwaysprevail and that relationship will sink them both. In other words,the disciple has some desires and needs from the guru, apartfrom pure spiritual progress, and vice versa, and this will‘drown’ both of them. What is the meaning of guru? Guru meansheavy, therefore he will sink and will sink others with him. Thosewho have taken the responsibility of being a guru are in theprocess of sinking and they also pull others down along withthem. It is not possible to become a guru without having agurukilli (master key).Questioner : What is a gurukilli? Is it the awareness ofthe pure Self?Dadashri : No, if it were, then one would attain moksha.Gurukilli used to be given out in the days of Lord Mahavir.Anyone can be a guru provided he is free from all desires ofindulging in sensual pleasures (vishays). This world is full ofpeople afflicted with such diseases (caught in sensual pleasures).In order to be a guru one needs to have a gurukilli in his hands.Here some become gurus with a handful of disciples and whentheir disciples start worshipping them, they become intoxicatedwith the ego (keyf) of respect. But with a gurukilli they wouldmaintain normality.Why on earth do people become gurus without agurukilli? How can you become a guru without the Gnani Purushgiving you a gurukilli? Gnani Purush is gurutam (the highest ofall; the supreme amongst gurus; there is no one greater than him)and He is also laghutam (the lowliest of the low, the mosthumble one and there is no one lower than him). If you call ‘us’Acharya, ‘we’ would tell you that ‘our’ state is even higher thanthat. And if you call ‘us’ a donkey, ‘we’ will tell you that ‘we’are even lower than a donkey. Now how can you recognizesuch a gurutam-laghutam Purush? And if you do happen torecognize such a Purush, then your work is done.Moksha halted by Self-guided whim (swachhand)One will have to get rid of the disease called swachhandthat has accompanied one from countless past lives. This diseaseAptavani-2521522Aptavani-2the same are all students. If both the teacher and the studentsare renouncing or turning the beads on a rosary, then can we notconclude that they are in a ‘standard’ i.e. they are both in theprocess of studying? If you ask them, “Sir, have you finishedstudying?” they will say, “We have finished studying but we stillhave to do our rosary.” No! If you want to attain moksha, thenrealize that moksha and the wooden rosary beads are foes. Youhave to dwell (ramanata) in the realm of the Self for moksha.These people are dwelling in the wooden beads and thereforethey will not attain moksha. This is just a type of a business theyhave started. ‘We’ have to make this statement in order to alertand caution them.There should not be any business in religion but religionshould definitely be present in all business. Wherever there aretransactions of money in any religion, understand that it is not atrue religion.A person can still attain moksha if he asks for guidancebut he does not do this either.

You go around saying, ‘I am. Iam’, but what are you all about?” Swachhand has no place tostand if you surrender to someone. When one remainssubservient to someone he will not have any self guided initiativeand action (swachhand). Become anyone’s subordinate and theswachhand will depart. That is why Krupaludev has said:“Roke jiva swachhand to paame avasya moksha”“If one ceases swachhand, one will definitely attain moksha.”And then Krupaludev has also shown us how to get ridof that swachhand by stating the following:“Pratyaksh Sadguru yogathi swachhand te rokaya,“Through a direct meeting with a Sadguru, swachhand can bestopped.anya upaya karya thaki praye bamano thaaya”Through attempts of any other kind, it will only grow manyfolds.” True guru – true discipleThe problem with the ascetics and sanyasi gurus nowadaysis that they are not subservient to anyone. They would not haveconflicts with their disciples if they were. Their problems wouldbe solved if either the guru was to remain subservient to hisdisciple or the disciple was to remain subservient to the guru.What is wrong in the guru being deferential towards the disciplein certain aspects? When a guru does not have eyes, does henot become dependent on his disciples? So, for one life, if aguru with good eyes becomes subservient and deferential to hisdisciples, then the problem would be solved. A guru may feelthat his disciple will take advantage of him. Is the disciple reallygoing to take advantage of the guru? What independent powerdoes he have? He himself is being controlled by his prakruti. Buttoday it is hard to find a true guru who is completely desire less(nispruha). The guru-disciple relationship is based on a mutualself-serving need; the guru has his own self-interest where hisdisciple is concerned and the disciple has his own self-interestwhere the guru is concerned. Nobody cares about moksha; ifthey did they would swear upon their father’s grave. All the gurucares about is getting more disciples and being worshipped.However, there are few exceptions; some two to five inhundreds. What has the Lord said? He has said, “Do whateveryou have to in your worldly life, lie if you have to, but do notmisguide anyone where religion is concerned.” There istremendous responsibility and liability in that. These gurus havecovered up statements such as this made by the Lord out of fearof what people would do if they knew? The Lord has said a lotmore.The acharyas and maharajs in the days of the vitaragswere very wise. If a young 18-year-old newly initiated sadhuwere to ask an 80-year-old acharya maharaj, “Maharaj, willyou listen to what I have to say?” the acharya would feel so badthat his awareness lacked so much that the young disciple hadto even ask this of him. A Jain acharya will listen to what peoplehave to say. They would even listen to someone with a differentreligious conviction, with poise and calmness. Today, no one isready to listen to anyone.What are the qualities of a true acharya? Just one sternlook from him will make hundreds of his disciples sweat. Hedoes not have to chastise anyone; he can simply get his workdone with his eyes. The acharya’s own purity and moral integrity(sheelvan) does the work. Acharyas should be sheelvan. Thedisciples need to have a certain fear hanging over them. Not fearlike that of a police official or an ordinary person of authority butthe fear of someone with moral integrity and purity (sheel).

If you want to fast fortwo days, the maharaj will give you his blessing and tell you,“Fast for two days.” His vachanbad which is the energy behindhis words is such that you will constantly remember what he hastold you and you will not take any short-cuts or cheat.

You have renounced woman, luxuries, clothes etc.We know all that, but maharaj you are still a worldly person.The Lord has made a division of two categories of the livingbeings, one is sansari (worldly) and the other ‘siddha’ (liberatedSouls). Anyone other than the siddha is a worldly being. Of theworldly beings, the Lord has said He accepts all those who havebecome karan-siddha (the causal siddha i.e. in the process ofbecoming siddha) as siddha. The Lord affirms, “I call the causalsiddhas as siddha; I call them asansari (not worldly).” DearGod! Do you mean to say that those who have becomeliberated are asansari and those who are in this world are alsoasansari? The answer is, ‘Yes. I give that status to those who arecausal siddhas (karan siddhas).’ Then one may ask, “DearLord, you are giving this status to those who are causal siddhabut what about the others, what wrong have they done?” TheLord explains, “Karan-siddha is considered as siddha becausethey are going to be siddha (fully liberated) in the near future andtherefore we grant them the reservation of that seat right now.”We ask, “Lord, why are you being partial in dealing with all ofus here in this world?

So how can youcall those who experience moksha, worldly (sansari)?”Lord Mahavir had tremendous wisdom from a very youngage. The Lord left this world at the age of 72. He was verywise. How wise? At the age of 30, His wisdom was such thatit gave everyone around, tremendous happiness. He did notreally leave home when He did; it was all due to circumstantialevidences. Just like when ‘we’ leave Santa Cruz to come toDadar, does that mean that ‘we’ have left Santa Cruz? No.Those were the circumstantial evidences of that event. We areall guided by vyavasthit; scientific circumstantial evidences. Weact according to the way vyavasthit makes us, from within. TheLord had nothing left to do. The one who has no doer-ship left,has nothing left to suffer. How can the one who has no doer-shipleft, have anything to suffer or experience?Whatever the Lord said, these maharajas have adheredto; they claim they are Jain ascetics. Whom does the Lordconsider a karan-siddha (causal siddhas)? Sadhus, upadhyays,acharyas and tirthankaras (all part of the Panch Parmeshti, allthat have attained the Self) are those to whom the Lord hasgiven the status of karan-siddhas. They appear as worldlybeings (sansaris) but there is a difference in the way theyexperience things. All four experience the bliss of the Siddha andyou all experience worldly pain and pleasure. All the acharyamaharajas claim, “We cannot be considered sansari (worldlybeings).” But maharaj, on what basis are you not a worldlybeing? Give ‘us’ some proof so that ‘we’ can believe that. Intesting, even if ‘we’ see 25% gold, ‘we’ will accept it to be100%.’ Now, how much more lenient can ‘we’ get? ‘We’ areready to accept 25% as being 99%. However, after ‘we’explain everything to them, the maharajs themselves accept thatthey cannot be considered karan-siddha. I ask them, how theycan experience the state of the siddha when they still have theirkashays. Ask them, “Maharaj you still have kashaya, do younot?” and they will say, “The kashays are still there.” Then youcan say, “Then you are not a karan-siddha.” The maharajhimself will say, “No, I am a sansari.” If you ask them, will theynot tell you so? They will. If they say that they are free ofkashays, then you will immediately find out when you provokethem. They will get irritated even before you provoke them.People who are restless and troubled will become agitated andrestless even while they are talking.Hyperactivity and laziness : worldly and spiritualDo not become panicky and hyper (raghavatio) underany circumstance. The Self is never so, it is the absolutesupreme, so is there any need for restlessness? Drink tea, havesnacks, play music, do everything. Instead everyone is caught upin overt restlessness. The Gnanis of the Kramic path will not lettheir disciples drink even a glass of water in peace. If someoneis drinking water and takes too long, they will tell him, “Movefrom here. You are being spiritually lazy (pramaadi).” They donot let anyone drink water peacefully. They are restless andalways in a hurry. The heck with your label of laziness(pramaad)! Take your label of ‘spiritual laziness’ with you andgo home. We don’t want such a moksha! How can we followsuch a path of moksha where the master does not even allowus to drink water? Have you seen such hyperactivity on thespiritual path?Questioner : I have indeed!

What acontradiction!This Akram Vignan is a wonderful science that has comeAptavani-2529530Aptavani-2out; it will make the world speechless. It has been uncovered ‘asit is’, otherwise there would be hyperactivity and restlessnesshere too and Dada would not let you drink even a cup of teain peace. He will say, “Get up, haven’t you finished drinkingyour tea yet? Come and do bhajan, let’s have some action!” Butthere is no agitation or any other such thing here. There is norestlessness in the Self; it is the Supreme Self. Do you think thatthe Self would be crazy like this? If we become like the Self,then we will acquire it.Now how can my talks appeal to everyone? I am tryingto get rid of the word ‘pramaad’ (laziness) once and for all.Here people get rid of the lazy self and move towards theagitated and the restless one. In this back and forth, when willyou attain the real Self? You already had a lazy atma, and thenyou move towards a fidgety one. At least the lazy atma wasbetter; it would not hurl ‘rocks’ at anyone. With this hyperactiveatma, you even shove people sometimes. Lazy people do nothave such problems; those poor guys will walk slowly. This doesnot mean that ‘we’ like lazy people, but why do you have somuch abhorrence towards laziness and such attachment for thehyperactive? You want to get rid of raag-dwesh and yet you doraag-dwesh, how can that be acceptable? How can we handlepeople who would not let us drink a cup of tea in peace? Theywill shove and prod us even before we pour milk in our tea.That is how strict the Kramic path is. Krupaludev toldPrabhushri, “Go and learn Sanskrit.” Prabhushri said, “I am 46year old. How can I learn at this age and when will I be ableto master it? Instead, show me another way.” So Krupaludevreplied, “Queen Victoria is 76 year old and she is learning manydifferent languages. At the age of 76 she is learning our languageso why would you not be able to master your own motherlanguage? Go and learn it.” Prabhushri had to learn Sanskritbecause of the instruction from Krupaludev. Prabhushri used tosay, “I used to hold on to a pole and keep cramming, “Gumgachhati means to go, and gum gachhati means to go” sothat I would not fall asleep; so that laziness would not set in.Now tell me, how can one ever make progress this way? Hewas given twenty-two large books and was told, “Keep themwith you all the time and whenever you think about it, open themand look into them.” Such is the Kramic path. Krupaludev wasa Gnani Purush and his path is a correct path too. He was a trueGnani of these bad times (dusham kaad). But in fact howgrueling and painstaking the Kramic path is! This Akram path isnow available and it is so easy, and yet people discard it as ifit is nothing. So the right time is here. Here every minute isprecious. A time will come when one will not get to do ‘Dada’s’darshan for even a minute. When the world awakens to this‘living’ science is it just going to ignore it?There are two types of path to moksha: one path is takenby people who are quick and clever and the other by the easygoing people who enjoy things on the way. There are more ofthe former than the latter in this world. Truly we cannot call these(followers of Akram Path) pleasure-seekers but people usewords without any understanding. This Akram path is completelydifferent. There is no inner worldly attachment in this path; herethere is the pleasure of the relaxed, tension free pace for sure,but there is no attachment (moha) to the worldly life. This is thedifference between ours and the path of the ‘clever’ and hyperpeople. Both the paths are different. Those who are indulgentand pleasure seekers on this path start late but find a quickshortcut to make it up. They achieve a lot without much effort.Therefore, our ‘elevator path’ is different. It has blossomed inevery way. That is why Kavi says:“Gnani vikram toch, aishwarya hahakar.” ‘Gnani at the supreme peak is spreading his divine energiesto all around who are completely mesmerized by it.’This is the Akram Gnani. He seats victorious at the topAptavani-2529530Aptavani-2out; it will make the world speechless. It has been uncovered ‘asit is’, otherwise there would be hyperactivity and restlessnesshere too and Dada would not let you drink even a cup of teain peace. He will say, “Get up, haven’t you finished drinkingyour tea yet? Come and do bhajan, let’s have some action!” Butthere is no agitation or any other such thing here. There is norestlessness in the Self; it is the Supreme Self. Do you think thatthe Self would be crazy like this? If we become like the Self,then we will acquire it.Now how can my talks appeal to everyone? I am tryingto get rid of the word ‘pramaad’ (laziness) once and for all.Here people get rid of the lazy self and move towards theagitated and the restless one. In this back and forth, when willyou attain the real Self? You already had a lazy atma, and thenyou move towards a fidgety one. At least the lazy atma wasbetter; it would not hurl ‘rocks’ at anyone. With this hyperactiveatma, you even shove people sometimes. Lazy people do nothave such problems; those poor guys will walk slowly. This doesnot mean that ‘we’ like lazy people, but why do you have somuch abhorrence towards laziness and such attachment for thehyperactive? You want to get rid of raag-dwesh and yet you doraag-dwesh, how can that be acceptable? How can we handlepeople who would not let us drink a cup of tea in peace? Theywill shove and prod us even before we pour milk in our tea.That is how strict the Kramic path is. Krupaludev toldPrabhushri, “Go and learn Sanskrit.” Prabhushri said, “I am 46year old. How can I learn at this age and when will I be ableto master it? Instead, show me another way.” So Krupaludevreplied, “Queen Victoria is 76 year old and she is learning manydifferent languages. At the age of 76 she is learning our languageso why would you not be able to master your own motherlanguage? Go and learn it.” Prabhushri had to learn Sanskritbecause of the instruction from Krupaludev. Prabhushri used tosay, “I used to hold on to a pole and keep cramming, “Gumgachhati means to go, and gum gachhati means to go” sothat I would not fall asleep; so that laziness would not set in.Now tell me, how can one ever make progress this way?

He seats victorious at the topAptavani-2531532Aptavani-2and has made everyone joyous with laughter. Never mind thathe has indulged in leisure but he has also attained the path toliberation in a leisurely manner, has he not? What would happenhere if we were to say, “Don’t be lazy. Don’t be lazy?”Everywhere you look people run around in a state of agitatedrestlessness; even when they eat they are not at peace. Why areyou so agitated and hyperactive? Is it to get rid of laziness?Laziness leaves but it is replaced with restlessness. The same oldghost! On the contrary, the ghost of hyperactivity is worse. If acertain sadhu has been invited for a meal, he would go. Hewould not be fidgety. And if you meet some other sages on theroad and if you tell him to wait while you do darshan ofSuryanarayan (Sun God), by the time you do darshan and youturn around, he would be gone! What is the reason? It is nothingbut hyperactivity driven by the clever mind. No matter what hedoes, whether he eats, drinks, goes to the toilet or anything else,he is hyperactive. Instead why not enjoy a nice meal and takeyour time with it? No one likes to see one who is agitated andhyperactive. In order to rid themselves of their laziness, theybecame hyperactive. Laziness (pramaad) was much better. The‘ghost’ of laziness was better; at least one was familiar with it.But this new ghost of hyperactivity takes hold and one has noexperience or understanding of it. People try to get rid oflaziness without understanding anything.What is the reason for this hyperactivity (raghavat)?They say it is because they have gotten rid of laziness. You donot have to get rid of laziness of the physical body; on thecontrary it had to be preserved. You have to relax on yourcouch even if others complain, even if the couch complains andsqueaks. It is just a couch, not a living thing, is it? Now if it wasa living thing, then you will immediately get up, but let the couchcomplain. You can buy a new one if it squeaks too much. Butone would say, “No I can’t do that. Laziness will set in’ and sohe will not make himself comfortable and sit. He will sit withoutease. He will get irritated even if you ask him a question. Doesthat suit him? The Lord has told us to take it easy. Do you thinkthe vitarag Lords were like that? These people move so fast thatwithin no time they are nowhere to be seen! Do you think thatLord Mahavir used to walk this way? He would walk slowly,regally and in great ease. When you become restless from withinthen you become restless externally. Hyperactivity and agitationon the inside will also become hyperactivity and agitation on theoutside. Then he will see everything else moving; even the trees!These religious heads (auliyas) do not have suchrestlessness and hyperactivity. They are laid back and relaxed.If we say, “Is the sky going to fall?” He will reply, “No sir, it willnot fall.” Whereas these people here maintain, “I have done it,and I will have to suffer.” Hence, what happens when the skyfalls (a calamity occurs)? The right understanding that hasbecome wrong is the reason why bitter fruits have come about,otherwise why would the world be this way?A hyperactive person (with both inner and outerhyperactivity) after attaining Gnan will not be able to remain inshuddha upayog (awareness as the Self). Even if you were to‘give’ such a person shuddha upayog, it will not stay with himbecause he is hyperactive. When you all eat, drink; go out, youdo it with upayog; with awareness. Whereas the hyperactiveperson keeps thinking, “My awareness (shuddha upayog) willdefinitely go away in doing all these mundane things.” No theshuddha upayog remain in all activities. Whether the tea is strongor not, sweet or not, our awareness remains for sure.The word ‘pramaad’ has killed spirituality. They have notunderstood the word pramaad at all. Even if he wakes up at fourin the morning and does all his kriyas (spiritual rituals), if we askLord Mahavir, the Lord would say, “These are all pramaadi;completely pramaadi (spiritually apathetic). Not even a fractionof their spiritual sloth is gone.”Aptavani-2531532Aptavani-2and has made everyone joyous with laughter.

When does that pramaad go away?It goes away when the aropit bhaav; the illusion of, ‘I amChandulal’ leaves. As it is there is so much intoxication but nowthere is pramaad. ‘I am Chandulal’ is maad (the intoxication)and to languish and enjoy in the marriage party is pramaad (thatwhich follows the maad, to proceed in the illusion). It is pramaadwhen one enjoys the comfort and the coolness of goodcircumstances but gets irritated and restless in bad ones.Becoming entrenched in the false location (I am Chandulal) ismaad, and to enjoy that false location is pramaad.People think getting up late in the morning is pramaad. Butthat is laziness. Not getting up early is a vitamin for a lazyperson. He will get up late and then run for the train at the lastminute and catch it in time. Therefore, getting up late is a vitaminfor a lazy person.The ascetics interpreted the word pramaad in their ownway, whereas the Lord has said it differently. Only the Lord’sdefinition is of use to us. Following the Lord’s commands is likefollowing the needle of a compass. The Lord’s Gnan will showthe true North (path); others will take you South. The needlemay point North; but it will take you towards South.

What is one living on?One lives on the foundation of this ‘this’. If he did not, he wouldattain the Self. Currently the self (worldly self) is absorbed inplaying in ‘this’ (in ramanata). If playing in ‘this’ (ramanata)becomes unpleasant and unattractive, then the attainment of theSelf is inevitable. But, because there is the play, interest andabsorption in ‘this’, the self says, “You are fine, carry on as youare in your town. I am fine here in my town!” The play of theself is always in one location or the other (non-self or the Self).Because it is at this other location (the world, the non-self), oneis able take that as the foundation of life. If the play (ramanata)does not exist in any subatomic particle (parmanu), in the non-self (pudgal), then there is no go, except to attain the Self. ‘We’have no play (delving, enjoyment, absorption) into even a singlesubatomic particle of the pudgal, the non-self. ‘We’ arecontinuously absorbed in the Self as the Self (atma ramanata).Aptavani-2533534Aptavani-2What is pramaad?

One may get a hint of the Self, but he will not become theSelf. He will not become the Self that the Lord has described.Such a Self is absolutely still (achad atma). All other states ofSoul are unsteady and ‘mobile’. As long as there is dwelling inthe non-self, the self will be unsteady and mobile (chanchadatma). The Lord has said that there are two kinds of dwellings:one is that of the pure Self (shuddha chetan, Shuddhatma). Thisis the dwelling of the supreme Self (parmatma). If this dwellingis not there, then there is the dwelling in the non-self, which isalso considered dwelling in the toys. It is considered as playingwith toys.Everything is a play of toysYes, even children play with toys, do they not? If you givea five-year-old a toy a two-year-old would play, will he playwith it? No, he will not. He will tell you, “These are not my toys;these are for little children.” Therefore, an older child will notplay with toys younger children play with and vice versa. Aneleven-year-old child will not play with the toys of a five-year-old. He will say, “I want to play cricket.” Then he will play‘toys’ such as cricket, football, volleyball etc. Then by ageeighteen he develops an interest for books. Then books willbecome his ‘toys’. What do we call this liking and interesttowards the books? Wherever there is liking (ruchi) towardssomething it is called ramanata (engrossment through enjoyment).Therefore, books, football, dolls are all considered toys. Thenwhen he turns twenty-two, he will tell you, “Now, I don’t wantto play with these dolls. I will need a larger, living doll!” Let goof your madness! What is wrong with other dolls? We can getyou a Japanese one (mannequin) dressed up in a sari, howabout that? But he will say, “No. I want a live one!” and he willget a live one! If you ask him if he is content now and hasstopped playing with all the other toys, he will tell you he is andthat he has. Then he spends four married years having fun untilpeople start asking, “You have been married four years, do younot have any children?” So then he thinks he is short of that toyand gets interested in that toy.Then there is a boy who wants to take a vow ofrenunciation (diksha) when he turns twenty-two. “No, I want totake diksha.” If you ask him, “Don’t you want a living doll?” hewill tell you, “No. I don’t like that kind of toy. I will search forthe toys of renunciation. Those that do not involve live dolls astoys are my toys.”Some men get married and have children and then theirkarmic circumstances unfold in such a way that they beginfighting with their wives. Their karmic account for renunciationcomes into effect. So what do they do? They make their wivesand children sign a letter of release which states that they arepleased to release them so that they can pursue their quest forliberation. They make their family cry but they will make themsign such a letter. All these ascetics that have come here havecome by making their families cry.

There are a fewwho are not smart at studying but are at least smart enough tounderstand that they do not like living in the worldly life becausethey have to work, earn money to buy groceries. They have togo to work everyday. They have to face all other kinds ofproblems in the worldly life so they have figured it is better tobecome a sadhu.

Who will question whether they knowAptavani-2537538Aptavani-2something or not? This is how some have become sadhus. Onlyfive to ten percent of them are real sadhus. There are some wholeave behind millions of dollars in order to become a sadhu. Ifyou ask them, “Did you not enjoy playing with all that money?Did you not enjoy playing with all that wealth? Did you notenjoy your life with your wife? What have you come here for?What toys have you come here to play?” They will say, “I havecome here for the salvation of the world.” You fool! In whichprevious life have you not done that? How are you going to dogood for the world when you have not done anything for yourown self?Now for how long can such lack of understandingcontinue? Will you not have to follow the right understanding ofthe vitarags? At the same time they also sing, “Get rid of par-ramanata (dwelling in the non-self), get rid of par-ramanata.”What do you understand by par-ramanata? Everything thatyou play with is par-ramanata. So how would you get rid of allthat? Some say, “They are looking after the well-being of thesociety. They are increasing the number of Jains.” Why wouldyou worry whether the number of Jains increase or decrease?Why would you worry about that, which Lord Mahavir did notconcern Himself with? Your guru’s guru, his guru and the guruof the whole world, Lord Mahavir, has not worried aboutincreasing the number of Jains, then who are you to be worryingabout that? Is your chit on a merry-go-round or what? Youwould have been better off increasing children at home; youwould have at least five or a dozen. But instead, you abandonedyour children! How can you call someone like this, a Jain? Willyou not have to understand the truth? How long are you goingto talk this way without any substance? You will have to knowthe truth, and then you will get to know the Self. Swa-ramanatawill arise as par-ramanata goes away.Do you now understand what ramanata is? Till the veryend they make you ‘play’ with the scriptures. The guru engagesthe disciples in a play and vice versa and then they claim, “Thisis the path to moksha.” This cannot be the path to moksha. Thesadhus, maharajs, acharyas etc., they all play with scriptures.The Lord has said that man keeps playing with ‘toys’ till the endbut what does he gain? You have played with these toys so getout, if it is liberation that you seek. You may argue, “But Lord,these are your scriptures and Agams.” The Lord would tell you,“But you get out because you have only played with ‘toys’ youhave never played with the Self.” ‘We’ give moksha throughswa-ramanata! That is why ‘we’ have told you not to touch thescriptures.Keep dwelling in the Self. Those who have not attainedthe Self, continue playing endlessly with the toys. All theseacharyas and the likes in the world keep playing with toysincessantly. Only our mahatmas play with the Atma, the Self.They are in swa-ramanata. People do not understand this subtlefact and then whole day long they keep playing with scripturesand then they get upset when they cannot find their books. TheLord has made it very clear in the scriptures that you should notget upset and that you should not hurt anyone. But people dothat anyway. Have the scriptures told anyone to get upset thisway? People get upset when they lose the very book that tellsthem not to get upset! All these people play with toys so whatgood does it do when they get upset? They read scriptures formillions of years and yet they get more attached to thescriptures. When they get involved in the worldly ramanata, theyget attached to that. They go back and forth from one fire toanother. The scriptures too, are toys. The scriptures are therefor one to proceed towards the Self so this purpose is valid,however the true ramanata (dwelling) is that of the Self, all otherramanata is par-ramanata; it is in the non-self.One sadhu asked, “I do not have a single possession(parigraha) that is worldly, so will I attain moksha?” ‘We’ toldhim, “No, you will not.” There is no moksha until there is AtmaAptavani-2537538Aptavani-2something or not? This is how some have become sadhus. Onlyfive to ten percent of them are real sadhus. There are some wholeave behind millions of dollars in order to become a sadhu. Ifyou ask them, “Did you not enjoy playing with all that money?Did you not enjoy playing with all that wealth? Did you notenjoy your life with your wife? What have you come here for?What toys have you come here to play?” They will say, “I havecome here for the salvation of the world.” You fool! In whichprevious life have you not done that? How are you going to dogood for the world when you have not done anything for yourown self?Now for how long can such lack of understandingcontinue? Will you not have to follow the right understanding ofthe vitarags? At the same time they also sing, “Get rid of par-ramanata (dwelling in the non-self), get rid of par-ramanata.”What do you understand by par-ramanata? Everything thatyou play with is par-ramanata. So how would you get rid of allthat? Some say, “They are looking after the well-being of thesociety. They are increasing the number of Jains.” Why wouldyou worry whether the number of Jains increase or decrease?Why would you worry about that, which Lord Mahavir did notconcern Himself with? Your guru’s guru, his guru and the guruof the whole world, Lord Mahavir, has not worried aboutincreasing the number of Jains, then who are you to be worryingabout that? Is your chit on a merry-go-round or what? Youwould have been better off increasing children at home; youwould have at least five or a dozen. But instead, you abandonedyour children! How can you call someone like this, a Jain? Willyou not have to understand the truth? How long are you goingto talk this way without any substance? You will have to knowthe truth, and then you will get to know the Self. Swa-ramanatawill arise as par-ramanata goes away.Do you now understand what ramanata is? Till the veryend they make you ‘play’ with the scriptures. The guru engagesthe disciples in a play and vice versa and then they claim, “Thisis the path to moksha.” This cannot be the path to moksha. Thesadhus, maharajs, acharyas etc., they all play with scriptures.The Lord has said that man keeps playing with ‘toys’ till the endbut what does he gain? You have played with these toys so getout, if it is liberation that you seek. You may argue, “But Lord,these are your scriptures and Agams.” The Lord would tell you,“But you get out because you have only played with ‘toys’ youhave never played with the Self.” ‘We’ give moksha throughswa-ramanata! That is why ‘we’ have told you not to touch thescriptures.Keep dwelling in the Self. Those who have not attainedthe Self, continue playing endlessly with the toys. All theseacharyas and the likes in the world keep playing with toysincessantly. Only our mahatmas play with the Atma, the Self.They are in swa-ramanata. People do not understand this subtlefact and then whole day long they keep playing with scripturesand then they get upset when they cannot find their books.

Everyone is engaged in ramanata of toys. Readingscriptures, performing daily rituals etc., is like playing with toys.Having worldly things (parigraha) is not a hindrance to moksha.One can have as many possessions (parigraha) as he wants, butif he is in Atma ramanata (the Self), then that itself is moksha.One must not make unsupported statements like, “Liberation isattained only through non-possession (aparigraha).” If you haveattained swa-ramanata, then go ahead and marry 1300 queens!‘We’ don’t have a problem with that; you have to have theenergy to do so. If you have attained swa-ramanata then whatcan possibly obstruct you? Nothing can affect you if you attainswa-ramanata.Ramanata in situations : Ramanata in the EternalPeople would not understand such subtle talks. They donot have awareness of what swa-ramanata and par-ramanata is.There are two kinds of people: those who become engrossed incircumstances; they can be a sadhu, a celibate, an acharya orsomeone superior, whatever they are, they are all engrossedwith and in circumstances. The second kinds are those who getengrossed in the Self. These are the ones whom ‘Dada’ hasgiven Gnan to.Situations (avastha) are temporary and they come to anend. Coming to an end does not mean they will do so suddenlywithin an hour. Some may last up to three to four hours.Childhood may last ten to fifteen years; old age may last fortwenty years. Childhood, youth and old age are three longcircumstances. Even in childhood there are so many situationsand states (avastha) that arise. At the age of two, a boy runsaround naked and at that age it is acceptable. When hebecomes five years old and has to wear clothes he asks for toys.When he is eleven, if you give him toys for a five-year old, hewill not take them. He will tell you he wants a bat and a ball.If we ask him why he changes his toys, he will say his situation(avastha) has changed and that he has grown older. Situationschanged and he became older. This is how man plays with toysright till the end. Whatever toys he plays with, he dwells in thatsituation and he who plays with the Atma, dwells in the Atma.When one dwells in situations (avastha), he swings betweeneasiness (akud) and uneasiness (vyakud). And if he dwells inthe Self, he remains calm and collected (svastha). The GnaniPurush removes you from dwelling in situations and establishesyou in dwelling of the Self. This brings about the end of endlessdwelling in situations of life after life, and there arises a constantstate of Atma-ramanata. What can the Gnani Purush not do?There is nothing left to be done after attaining Atma-ramanata (the Self), otherwise would one not have to play withthe toys? Without Self-realization, where will one place the chit?He can try to place it inwards towards the Self, but not knowingwhere the Self is; he ends up placing it on external toys andplaying with them. At least while playing with these toys, the chitremains still for a while.What is the definition of a toy? It is that which causesabhorrence when it is lost and attachment when it is found.When one meets the Gnani Purush and makes a connection withhim and attains the Self, and then begins to dwell in the Self, theabhorrence and attachment leave and he becomes a vitarag!Until then he remains in the dwelling of the non-Self (prakruti).When the parayan; the total experience of the prakruti, the non-Self ends, one becomes a vitarag!Jai Sat Chit AnandAptavani-2539540Aptavani-2ramanata.
