# Active Experiment: Observer-Observed Unity

## Concept
The collapse or unity of observer and observed in direct experience.

## Research Question
How do different philosophical frameworks understand the relationship between the observing consciousness and what it observes? Where do they converge on this fundamental question?

## Current Status
- [ ] Jain exploration
- [ ] Buddhist exploration  
- [ ] Western analytical exploration
- [ ] Systems theory exploration
- [ ] Neuroscience exploration
- [ ] Synthesis attempt
- [ ] Practice generation

## Hypotheses

### Convergence Hypothesis
Different traditions will converge on the recognition that the observer-observed distinction is a functional construction that dissolves at certain states of consciousness.

### Tension Hypothesis
Frameworks will diverge on whether this unity is:
- An ontological fact (real unity)
- An epistemological limitation (appears unified but isn't)
- A phenomenological state (experience without metaphysical claims)

## Method
1. Each framework explores independently
2. Document all insights and limitations
3. Synthesizer identifies genuine convergences
4. Critic challenges any forced connections
5. Practitioner generates testable exercises

## Expected Outcomes
- Convergence on phenomenology (the experience of unity)
- Divergence on metaphysics (what unity means)
- Common practices despite theoretical differences

## Notes
This concept chosen as first experiment because:
- Central to consciousness studies
- Each framework has explicit positions
- Directly testable through practice
- Relevant to AI consciousness questions
